# WAR: Concerning Bolshevik WMDs

Posted by: esteriore

Nations involved: Esteriore, European Bolsheviks, Fascist Adrea

Following the recent threats from the European Bolsheviks to use Nuclear Weapons on Esteriore, the country has gone on complete and total lockdown. The entire population of major cities have been evacuated to the city's underground buker system, all of Esteriore's WMDs are pointed to the European bolsheviks and DEFCON 2 has been declared.

The military is making a last-ditch effort to bomb missile silos to avoid having them being launched anytime soon. If this operation does not succeed, we are afraid this will become a Nuclear war between the two countries. A blitz force is also being mobilized just in case things go even mire south than now.
