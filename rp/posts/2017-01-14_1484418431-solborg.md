The national elections in Solborg began at 15:00 Eastern European Time. Live results are available [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1o_g22nJzGG8BPgiaRosZMu12ipLBmZGy1DN9VsN6Tw8/pubhtml). The incumbent left-wing coalition is projected to win another victory, and the Pirate Party will most likely gain its first seats in the Parliament.

Results for the six national referenda will also be added soon.
