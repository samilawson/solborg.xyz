Nations involved: Afghanipakijikistan, NOPS, Al-Ghaza

Over the past week, ISV operatives have executed 527 Afghanipakijikistani civilians attempting to flee the war-torn country. 

The terrorist group has been very militant towards men, women, and children trying to leave ISV controlled territory in Southern Kandahar Province, and other parts of the country in which the faction has asserted its authority. 

The total number of refugees has risen to nearly 1,000,000 and according to some estimates by foreign Human Rights Organizations, this number may have already been surpassed. 

Following the recent NOPS withdrawal from Al-Ghaza, many Asylum seekers are stacking up along the border separating the two East-Asian countries
