# SPACE: Unmanned mission to Europa planned

Nations involved: Skolborg Space Initiative

The Skolborg Space Initiative, independently from the current international Lunar exploration project, is currently planning on an unmanned landing on Jovian moon of Europa and the Saturnine moon of Enceladus. The Project would have a 1.7 billion $ Government funding and a 1.5 billion $ Private sector funding. 760,000,000 $ amongst the latter would be held by actual citizen shareholders through a form of crowdfunding. The site, that has opened hours ago, has already 60,000 citizens with share ranging from 1$ to several thousand. The remaining 740,000,000 would come from private companies. Skolbanki, one of Skolborg's most important investment and commercial banks, has already funded 80 million. And several other companies have planned on investing dozens of millions in the project. The total cost would be 3.2 billion $. 

The cost would include a rocket, with a spacecraft resistant enough to get to Mars, where it will use the red planet's gravity assist to propulse faster to Jupiter and thus the journey could be completed by 2020.  In approach of the Jovian system the spacecraft would open and let two spacecraft free. The first one would use Jupiter's gravity assist and head for Enceladus, one of Saturn's moons, to collect water samples ejected from geysers. It would arrive there by 2022 at latest. There it will collect liquid water samples and analyse them to detect potential microbial life. The probe would also orbit Enceladus. The second spacecraft, composed of a probe equipped with a lander, and which compromises the major cost of the mission, will stay around and orbit Europa, precisely mapping its surface. The lander would detach from the probe and attempt a Europe landing, whilst the probe stays around, exploring Ganymede and Io. The lander would then analyse the atmosphere, the ice to see if it is really water ice, and send radio waves through the crust to estimate the depth of a potential liquid water ocean underneath Europa's icy surface. 

The information would be crucial to understanding if life outside earth is possible, and how, as well as how these moons could be the future living spaces of mankind. 

The takeoff of this mission could take place in the next few days.
