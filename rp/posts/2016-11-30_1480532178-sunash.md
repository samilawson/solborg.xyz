# GEN: Quarentine & aid

Posted by: sunash

Nations involved: Sunash, Vreekomfdod, Esteriore

After recent unfortunate events, Sunash and Vreekomfdod have preemptively quarantined their nations and closed all borders. We have agreed to send aid and materials, but not people, to aid Esteriore with the hopes that they would do the same for us had we fallen into such dire straits. If Esteriore accepts our aid, we shall begin sending it immediately. We also wish to have strains sent, very securely and contained, to Northern Vreekomfdod for study.
