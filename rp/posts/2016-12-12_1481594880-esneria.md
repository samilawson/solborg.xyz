# GE: Riot leads to Revolution

Posted by: esneria

Nations involved: Esneria

In a sudden turn of events, a large riot in Esneria’s capital lead to a full-scale revolution, which ousted the fascist regime overnight. 

At the moment, no plans to create a new centralized government have been set forth by the revolutionary group. The current provisional government lead by an underground democratic organization during the Autocracy have drafted some concepts for an Esnerian election in the spring of next year.

In the early hours of the revolution’s aftermath, imprisoned Bigtopians throughout the country have been released by local resistance movements.

Whether or not the former dictatorship will truly become a state free from tyranny remains to be seen, however the population is certain that the Nation’s future promises democracy.
