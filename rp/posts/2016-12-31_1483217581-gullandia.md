# EXPLORATION: Gullandia Sets her Sights on the North Pole

Posted by: gullandia

Nations involved: Gullandia

After seeing that other nations appear to have their sights set on space, the head of Gullandia's Exploration and Expansion Committee, Miss Edel Falk has announced that an unmanned submarine will be exploring beneath the arctic ice caps.

When announcing the mission, Miss Falk talked about how, "we [the human race] must discover more about our own planet before taking on another, and I believe the sea floor of the geographical north pole is a great place to start. The submarine to accomplish this mission [Malik1] will be equipped with a robotic arm and special containers to obtain and return samples of the sea floor for experimentation and analysis."

The crew controlling the submarine is set to arrive on the arctic ice cap January 3rd where they will then release Malik1. The crew will return to Gullandia January 6th with the information they have gathered. Miss Falk also mentioned that this does not exclude Gullandia from potential space missions in the future.
