# WAR: Samsonia3 Takes Alexandria/Alexshire!

Posted by: samsonia3

Nations involved: Samsonia3, Georgekenia

Samsonia3's false news reports of invading Cairo have succeeded in tricking Georgekenia! The main force, led by tanks and planes, actually went all the way to Alexandria/Alexshire, the Capital, and has marched upon Georgekenia's Capital Building! It is being surrounded currently. Samsonia3 demands Georgekenia give up its nuclear program, or they will burn Alexandria to the ground.

Comms have gone down in Alexandria as the result of Samsonia3's army shooting telephone poles in the area. Tanks are crushing any dissidents as well as many buildings, and warplanes are on watch for any plans Georgekenia might make. The citizens might be angry, but they are not an army and they value their lives enough not to foolishly fight. Samsonia and their still-unnamed ally now hold Alexandria. 

Again, if Georgekenia does not wish to negotiate, the Capitol Building will be burnt down. If they still won't talk, we will raze the entire city.
