# HABNA: Refugees unlikely to return home after war

Posted by: habna

Nations involved: Habna, Stoichia, Solborg

Although Habna is victorious it is doubtful that those who left would come back to a Habna in ruins.
The middle class refugees will probably set up shop in their new countries, and the rebel refugees could not return if they wanted to because they would be killed.
It is advised that rebel Habnian refugees and mid class Habnian refugees be separated into different neighborhoods.
