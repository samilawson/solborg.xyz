Posted by: fascist_adrea

Nations involved: Fascist Adrea, European Bolsheviks

The million-man army of Adrea is finally arriving back in Рагуза, being paraded as heroes for their valiant effort in the latest war. However, their home coming will only last so long, as they're already being sent Northeast to the border, reinforcing the reserves set there. Thousands of aircraft cover the skies over Hungary, searching for any sign of Bolsheviks.
