# TERROR: Habna not responsible for terrorism

Posted by: habna

Nations involved: Habna, Mandalae, Gal May, New Nexon

The government of Haban is outraged that Gal May would believe the small nation would sponsor a terror attack in a far away country for no apparent reason.
All Habna wants is to have control o er its borders and repair its infastructure, unlike the previous nuclear Georgkenian issue, this Habnian action to not accept refugees is not an agressive act towards any nation, and the refugees are sure to be accepted elsewhere.

"Let me clarify Habna is against terrorism, and that is partially why we did not want these refugees as many could not be trusted, and even if they could I scream again, we don't not have the accomadations I'm this country to support them."
