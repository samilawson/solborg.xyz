# SPACE: Amaldrus accepts Kolami proposal

Posted by: amaldrus

Nations involved: Amaldrus, Habna, Kolam Brotherhood

The Amadlrussians have agreed to change priority to the moon, and share the base with other groups, however Amaldrus is still planning to have a small colony as well, nothing major, just an outpost not to far away from the international one, with minumum staff and stuff.
The planned extra outpost the Amadlrussians want will not be started on until well after the international one is finished as it has priority. 
We hope the powers looking down on us can accept this compromise.
