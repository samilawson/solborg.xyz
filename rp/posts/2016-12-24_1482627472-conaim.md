# MORMON WAR: Conaim enters North American League

Posted by: conaim

Nations involved: Conaim, Utah, Vladimirstan, North American Nations in genral

In order to pressure bigger stronger Vladimirstan into declaring war on the illegitimate state of Utah, Conaim has applied to join the North American League.

We hope either Vladimirstan joins as well and or will cooperate with us against the Mormons, or if they are hostile we will have a collective force to make them let us into their part of Utah so we can stop the radical Mormon Sons of Utah.
