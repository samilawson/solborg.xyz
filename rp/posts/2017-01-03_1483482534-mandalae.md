Nations involved: Mandalae

It appears that the far-right's dream of independence from Mandalae will be short lived. 

Mandalaean troops have completely surrounded the last remaining rebels in the city of Zorfum, New Harrison, as all other resistance outside the city has been utterly crushed.

The air force is now conducting precision strikes on rebel compounds and centers in the hopes of bringing the insolent rebellion to a close.

President Hagden made a statement regarding the whole ordeal, simply saying, "It's sad. We've got some rebuilding to do."
