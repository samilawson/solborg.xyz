# GEN: Samsonia3 Demands European Bolsheviks stop Nuclear Development immediately!

Posted by: samsonia3

Nations involved: Samsonia3, European Bolsheviks

From the Supreme God-Emperor:

"European Bolsheviks. Stalinium doesn't exist. We all know. If you want to start making nuclear reactors, you're going to have to make a bargain. We demand you stop development until you do."

Also, Samsonia3 would like to welcome Al Ghaza into the LRN! This admittance has lead to a revitalization in the alliance! 

Thirdly, Samsonia3 offers their condolences to Samsonia2's SamsonXIV. They hope for a speedy recovery. "We may not be best friends, but he is still a good man," said the Supreme God-Emperor. Any nation who is found to have poisoned him will be dealt with.

Finally, Samsonia3 is undergoing a massive military upgrading. Our huge numbers of troops will now receive special training, and our weapons will be renewed. This spending on the military-industrial complex will also create many jobs in the nation.
