# GEN: Samsonia3 Launches Satellite Into Orbit

Posted by: portmany_arms_base

Nations involved: Samsonia3, Portmany Arms Base

Samsonia3 has launched their Mk.N1 Satellite into orbit. The undisclosed storage spaces are still just that, undisclosed. The satellite will orbit the earth rather simply, but propulsion jets can slightly alter the path the satellite takes. Samsonia3 has no desire currently to terraform other planets, though.
