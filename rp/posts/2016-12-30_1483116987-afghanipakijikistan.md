Nations involved: Afghanipakijikistan, Al-Ghaza

This morning, two suicide bombers assaulted a refugee camp on the outskirts of Herat, a city in Northern Afghanipakijikistan. 

The Attack killed 134 civilians that were standing in line to receive food rations. An additional 304 were injured, and are now being treated by foreign aid-workers inside the camp and at the hospital in Herat.

The radical violetist group ISV has claimed responsibility for the attack, stating that "this is merely the beginning. We are now training and sending sleeper agents to other countries in order to attack western institutions involved in Afghanipakijikistan."

An additional 400,000 Afghanipakijikistani citizens have fled the country, with nearly 290,000 at the border crossing between the War-torn Sultanate and the Emirate of Al-Ghaza.
