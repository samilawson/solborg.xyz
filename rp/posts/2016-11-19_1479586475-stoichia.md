Posted by: stoichia

Nations involved: Stoichia, Wastisia, Paninyava, NOPS

Today the PM of Stoichia, Garth Lovren, has announced that they will join NOPS.

He stated that while Stoichia will be part of NOPS they will want to have good relations with nations that are not in NOPS.

The PM also said that "... the reason being joining NOPS is mostly protecting Wastisia from Paninyava which has been a little aggressive to our 'younger brother'."
