The Prime Minister of Anglynd and the current regent of The Kolam Brotherhood announced earlier his bid for Newfoundland Island. He offered 8.001 billion Norrlandic Bitcoins (essentially Mandalae Western Credits) plus co-belligerent military assistance when at DEFCON 1. He also would allow Esteriore to continue keeping military equipment and personnel in any Esterian bases on the island if sold to The Kolam Brotherhood. The Kolam Brotherhood hopes this offer is reviewed and considered.
