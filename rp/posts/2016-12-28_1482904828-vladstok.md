Posted by: vladstok

Nations involved: Vladstok

In a ribbon cutting ceremony Tuesday, Prime Minister Olgya Estern officially put the Vladstok Extraterrestrial Aeronautics Agency (VEAA) into commission. She also set the groundwork for a series of satellites to be launched over the following months.

In a press statement, the Prime Minister said "The [VEAA] has actually been at work for years now, we just did not want to announce it to the public for fears that we would lose interest in the Agency before any real projects could be completed".

Regarding the timetable for satellites, the newly ordained Chief of Aeronautics, Dmitry Valto, said that "[The VEAA] will be announcing satellite launches a month in advance, in order to allow our people and our neighboring nations time to make any preparations they may need to make, for whatever reason they may wish to make said preparations. The VEAA is wholly dedicated to claiming Vladstok's piece of space is whatever peaceful way we can." 

The first satellite launch is unknown, but based on the press statements, we can expect the first announcement in the coming weeks or months. The whole of Vladstok is buzzing with anticipation.
