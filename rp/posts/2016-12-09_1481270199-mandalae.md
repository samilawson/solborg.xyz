Posted by: mandalae

Nations involved: Mandalae

The Mandalaean government announced Thursday that a new national monument will be constructed in the city of Truckee in the Alaska Province. 

The monument will commemorate the Russian-Alaskan War (1798-1801), the war that granted Mandalae its independence from the Russian Empire.

A large stone base will be accompanied by two Mandalaean riflemen holding each other up, walking back to the fight on top of it.
