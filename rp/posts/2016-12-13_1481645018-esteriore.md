# NUKE: Warhead Identified

Posted by: esteriore

Nations involved: Esteriore, Nerisis, Kataria, Adrea

Recently, it has been reported that a Nuclear warhead has been stolen. The missile has been identified as Missile A38B. This missile has been missing ever since the aircraft carrier was hijacked earlier this month. It is suspected that the Esterian Mafia took this missile from the ship, as our Aircraft carrier often has Nuclear Submarines on it. 

The Esterian mafia reaches all corners of the world and is deeply involved in other nation's black markets, but this is a scenario that could have never been predicted. Our foreign Minister would like to meet Katarian government officials to discuss who might be purchasing the weapons.
