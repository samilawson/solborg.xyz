Nations involved: Stoichia, Afghanipakijikistan, Habna, Georgekenia

The PM of Stoichia has announced that Stoichia will not be able to accept any Afghanipakijikistani refugees until the end January.

The reason behind this is that Stoichia is not able to house many refugees after many Habnian refugees flooded the country in the civil war and more houses for asylum seekers need to be built. It is expected that the houses will be built by the end of January.

When the refugees will be accepted they will have to learn the Stoichian language (Stoichian Sacod) and the Stoichian culture.

The PM has said that, while Stoichia didn't accept the refugees, he is disgusted with the comments made about them by the leaders of Habna and Georgekenia. He has also said that Stoichia has a valid reason for not accepting the refugees for a period of time.
