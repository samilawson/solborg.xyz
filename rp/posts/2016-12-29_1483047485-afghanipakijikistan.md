# GE: Civil War, Refugees

Posted by: afghanipakijikistan

Nations involved: Afghanipakijikistan, Al-Ghaza

Last Night, the Royal Palace in Kabul was overrun by a rebel militia lead by extremist Violetist sympathizers from Mazari Sharif, Afghanipakijikistan's northern city. 

Abu Al-Fawaris has not yet been found following his mysterious disappearance nearly a month ago, with numerous rebel groups setting a large bounty on the former Sultan's head.

Muhammad Abdullah Al-Safar, leader of another Violetist sympathizer group in Kandahar and Sangin, has declared that once Abu Al-Fawaris is captured, he will be "used as fertilizer for poppy fields."

Muhammad Abdullah has also declared war on NOPS, despite his inability to fight a large-scale war. His militia has captured most of Southern Afghanipakijikistan, and is currently fighting other government loyalists in Loman. 

Several other rebel groups have entered the conflict, which has already killed 50,000 and displaced 400,000 Afghanipakijikistani civilians, most of which are seeking passage through Al-Ghaza to gain asylum in Europe.
