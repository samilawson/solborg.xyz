Adrea, hearing of the recent uncalled-for invasion of New Yorkia, has nationally called for support of the capitalist nation, and Iaerme Pales announced officially that the nation will support New Yorkia, at least at the negotiation tables, and has offered, though not yet sent, military support, as well as the highest security and best quality hotel in Firz for the government of NY to stay in refuge within. Adrea has also sent a delegation to Samsonia3, their ally, to join a war in the case that Adrea is brought into one.
