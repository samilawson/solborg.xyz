Posted by: samsonia3

Nations involved: Samsonia3, Adrea

Samsonia3 has sent out its 3 brand-new  "PAB-567" Aircraft Carriers into the Mediterranean. These carriers are equipped with anti-missile systems as well as 9 S3-500 Warplanes, one S3-007 Tank, and one S3-008 tank, along with 7,000 troops, all on each carrier. They are headed east, and whether this is a flexing of their military muscles or a military endeavor still remains in question. Also, many of Samsonia3's soldiers have been positioned in Eastern Algeria and have begun a "Training March" eastwards. They request permission to pass through Toreig. If not, they will just do the march to the south of Toreig. It is unknown how many soldiers are participating in the march.

On another note, Tulsakastan has become the latest nation to join the LRN! We welcome them to our alliance and hope for great things in the future!
