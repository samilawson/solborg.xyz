Posted by: habna

Nations involved: Habna, Gal May

After Gal Mayan authorities released the detained Habnians agents sent to help Gal Mayan authorities, one of them was killed by a protester, The premier has gathered a speech from parliament to read on their behalf. Some officials even call the killing an act of terror against the State of Habna.

"We just wanted to be in control of our own nation, and we get blamed for a random terrorist strike because of it. Then we try to gain back trust by aiding investigation..then they are imprisoned after finding important evidence! And when they are released, one of them is killed by protesters! In an indirect way, the only thing they were protesting is Habna's Security and Sovereignty, and they should be ashamed. However I am glad that they were released but don't expect us to help you in the future after this.''
-Natata Worshnev Conference on behalf of parliament.
