Posted by: esteriore

Nations involved: 

Esteriore will be sending 20,000 Troops to Eastern Betuitia and begin a land invasion. They will be equipped with gas masks. Tents will be brought along as well to provide shelter for other nation's soldiers. 

Aircraft carriers are also making their way towards the coast of Al Ghaza. They will carry AeVo fighter airplanes and missile defense systems to defend against potential nuclear warheads. Any other supplies needed will gladly be provided to peacekeeping nations. Sanctions will also be placed on Betuitia for their use of chemical weapons and threat of nuclear war.
