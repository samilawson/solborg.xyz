Posted by: new_telemark

Nations involved: Solborg, New Telemark

Solborg and New Telemark have agreed to enter a joint research program to try to find a cure or, more likely, a vaccine for the new strain of influenza that is now being carried by birds. Other scientifically advanced nations may join as well. New Telemark has also closed its northern border with Esteriore, cancelled all international flights, and advised citizens to stay indoors and avoid birds.
