# GEN: The Khyren Pact

Posted by: esteriore

Nations involved: Esteriore, Hiachijan

In response to the creation of NOPS, Esteriore has taken a different route than many expected. This route involves creating an alliance, which is now known as The Khyren Pact.

So far, Hiachijan has joined the pact, and Esteriore is planning on recruiting Halvarda. This alliance will focus on many of the same values as NOPS, with a few key differences. These are: Nations are not forced to contribute troops and the alliance will focus much attention to economies. The Khyren Pact is expected to work closely with NOPS as well. 

Many people ask why this alliance was created, and government officials have responded by saying that competetion is good in the world. On another note, the name of the alliance is not final, and may change in the future. 

Esteriore is encouraging many nations to join either alliance, as they both share core values of peace and prosperity in Norrland.
