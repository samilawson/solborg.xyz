# TERROR: Calling their bluff

Posted by: centralstan

Nations involved: Centralstan, Cacusia

Centralstan verifys itself that it's government was not the culprit in the shorting of Causias leader, not because Centralstan is friends or anything with these people rather it seems like a stupid strategy against the Causian people, that infact was said by Dick Tator himself.

Centralstan would rather ha e its neighbors collectively put pressure on the poorly placed colony. Furthermore Centralstani officials question why Cacusia sent their leader to their colony,ex dog perhaps to initimdate them.
