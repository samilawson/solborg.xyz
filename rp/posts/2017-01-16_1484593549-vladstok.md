# DEFENSE: Vladstok to ask NOPS for Protection on Borders

Posted by: vladstok

Nations involved: Vladstok, NOPS, Troiya

Prime Minister Olgya Estern is officially requesting NOPS protection of Vladstok's border with Troiya, citing increasing instability from the government of Troiya.

"It is clear to us, as Vladstokians, as members of the NOPS, and as a proud, peaceful nation that we need help on our borders. Our neighbors have become increasingly volatile, and as the leader of our grand nation, it is obvious that we need outside help to stop the instability from spreading into our borders. We are ready to help in any way we can, but I do not believe our military can stand this test alone."

Such a passionate message is rarely seen from PM Estern, and it is clear that Vladstok is desperate.
