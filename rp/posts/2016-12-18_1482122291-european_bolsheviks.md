# WAR: European Bolshevik Army demobilizes, but remains on alert

Posted by: european_bolsheviks

Nations involved: European Bolsheviks, Fascist Adrea, Esteriore

Following recent peace talks, Esteriore and the PREB have signed a temporary peace agreement. 

Both sides will demobilize, but will remain alert in the event of further aggression from either side. 

Fascist Adrea, though absent from the meeting, will hopefully abide by the terms agreed upon by its fellow combatants. 

Estorian forces pushed back the Revolutionary Army into the PREB's southern region, and conflict seized along a line approximately drawn between Bratislava and Szeged.
