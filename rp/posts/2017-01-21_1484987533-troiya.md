# UPRISING: Borneo gains independence

Posted by: troiya

Nations involved: Troiya, Borneo, Mandalae, New Nexon

As Mandalaean and New Nexonan forces drive deeper into Borneo, a small coup in Samarinda turns into a full scale uprising. Funding from the two NOPS members lets the rebels overwhelm the Troiyan forces. The rebels eventually pushed into Balikpapan, where the main Troiyan navy port and military base is. Although most of the rebels were brutally killed or arrested, they managed to set off a bomb in the navy port stopping reinforcements coming to Troiya. It is expected that a Troiyan airstrike will take place on the rebel's base.

Borneo now has independence.
