# RELIGION: Catholic Pope Installed at Nanyang!

Posted by: new_nexon

Nations involved: New Nexon, Nanyang (Nexonan colony)

A Catholic papacy has finally been established at the Nexonan colony of Nanyang after the Nexonan government permitted the local Catholic population to establish a Nanyang Papacy.

22.5% (7 million) of the colony's population is Catholic, which is why the papacy is established in the first place. Francisco Cheng is coronated as the first Pope of the Nanyang Papacy, taking the name of Paul I. Despite fears that the act would provoke the Muslim population of Nanyang, the Muslim community gave their blessings for the Pope's crowning. The papacy will be headquartered at Malacca City.
