Nations involved: All

"An old tradition, a glorious and beautiful one, truly, that has sadly been lost to the sands of time," In a statement by Iaerme Pales, today, clad in a rather exquisite Adrean officer's uniform in Firz "is the tradition of the World's Fair. It was a great showcase of ingenuity and culture across our planet, it brought us as nations closer together through friendly competition in a race to out-invent and out-culture our fellow nations."

Iaerme has declared her intentions to bring upon a new golden age of prosperity, architecture, and ingenuity amongst humans by offering to host a new 'International Expo', or World's Fair, as it's more commonly known. She made a long speech on how historically, nations during the time of the World's Fairs were bent on invention and human greatness, with world wonders, music styles, entire cultures and fiction genre's being designed solely to impress tourists and visitors, and how it brought along great diplomatic relations and dialogue amongst those who participated.

She has already bid Paryзa (Dubrovnik) as the hosting city, with a theme of "Human Culture of the World", and, if Paryзa is chosen, will invite all nations to build their own multi-million-Nova display that will fit into a theme of expressing their nation's history, culture, and position in the world. She also requests that all nations attempt to design a new, groundbreaking invention if they are going to participate in the chance of Paryзa winning the hosting position.
