# SECURITY: European Bolsheviks Fortify Country

Posted by: european_bolsheviks

Nations involved: European Bolsheviks, Samsonia3

Fearing a potential invasion by the aggressive nation of Samsonia3, the Revolutionary Army has begun to heavily fortify the nation's borders and major cities.

"Following recent threats made by the Iberian Anti-Proletarian State Samsonia3, we have decided to prepare our country against any strike by the LRN and its criminal assailants".

All of European Bolsheviks' missile defense systems have been placed in strategic locations, and 600,000 reserves are on stand-by awaiting orders from the Glorious Immortal Dear Leader. 

This recent development does not conflict with the peace agreement with Adrea, since no travel-restrictions have been enacted against the fascist nation as a result of fortifications. However, the border is being heavily surveyed by European Bolshevik security forces and all Samsonians are prohibited from entering the People's Republic.
