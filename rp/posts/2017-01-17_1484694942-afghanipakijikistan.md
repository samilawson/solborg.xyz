Intelligence reports indicate that a new militant faction has entered the Afghanipakijikistani Civil War, called the People's Liberation Front.

The elusive group is made up of less than 1,000 member thus far, however despite their minimal size, the PLF is well trained, and has already seized control over Iranshahr, a city in the heart of ISV controlled territory. 

Additional intelligence has revealed that a significant amount of the group's members come from various foreign countries, and are united by ideology in a deadly war, which has already killed over 700,000 people after only one month of fighting.
