# SPY: Transcona condemns Centralstan

Posted by: transcona

Nations involved: Transcona, Centralstan, Cacusia

Following the recent news that a potential Cacusian spy was brutally executed in Centralstan, the Transconan government was quick to respond with public condemnation of the nation's barbaric practices, and an embargo.

The embargo will bar travel to the country, as well as tighten restrictions on goods going from Transcona to Centralstan.

Other nations are encouraged to take action against Centralstan to show the world that we do not tolerate such things.
