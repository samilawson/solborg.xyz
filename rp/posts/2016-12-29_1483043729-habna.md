Posted by: habna

Nations involved: Habna, New Nexon

"It just sounded like a good opportunity to represent Habna,"
She said in a press conference.
"It may also be enjoyable"

However, Habna's closest ally and former colony, Amaldrus has strongly opposed seeing an arranged marriage in a noble fashion, and that it is undemocratic.

Brody Smitters of Georgkenia has also openly said similar things including "Oh shight! looks at this! They are going to partys like its 1599, I right burthers?"

Natata Worshnev responds to Smitters by asking if he needs mental help of which Brody then thought she was insulting his dialect, thought she wasn't, he has sent 12 angry emails to her filled with hatred...Worshnev doesn't care though as she claims.
