# ECO: Economic Crash

Posted by: esteriore

Nations involved: Worldwide

A huge economic crash has just been reported to have begun by the Esterian National bank.

This is following a bubble in the Esterian loan sector, that was doomed to burst soon. The bubble was characterized by many things, most notably the excessive optimism in the Esterian economy, recent Bankruptcy of major banks and the failure of citizens to repay loans.

The effects have been widespread and extremely devastating, especially in North America and Europe. Unemployment is skyrocketing (Currently 12% in Esteriore), the Koppar has become almost worthless and the stock market is crumbling, losing a value of up to 37% for certain stocks and bonds.

Panic is becoming widespread across Esteriore, with some citizens already trading goods after the currency begun to inflate. Other countries are expected to feel the shock waves of the crash very soon, with Western European countries expected to fall next.

A complete failure of the financial system has begun, and the government is currently looking for solutions to stop the western world from falling into anarchy or converting to communism.
