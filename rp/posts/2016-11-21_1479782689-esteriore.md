Posted by: esteriore

Nations involved: Esteriore

Esteriore is calling the siege of the Jerusalem one of the most atrocious in revent history. Chemical weapons are being used frequently, disease runs rampant in the city. 

Esteriore calls on nations to help in this time of crisis, to provide the people of Jerusalem with food, water and supplies. We will be opening a donation service, all donations will be delivered via airlift to the people in the city.
