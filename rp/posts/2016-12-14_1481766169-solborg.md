# NOPS: Secretary General Denounces Secret Police

Posted by: solborg

Nations involved: Esteriore, NOPS

The NOPS Secretary General, Jans Åkesson, has condemned the secret police program set up by the government of Esteriore. He called it "a violation of basic democratic principles" and "an insult to the core values held by NOPS," the latter specifically referencing its potential use in foreign countries without their consent.

Åkesson also criticized the apparent lack of security maintained by the Esterian military which lead to the capture of a several billion dollar aircraft carrier and, potentially, nuclear weapon(s), saying "This kind of carelessness is simply unacceptable. We now have an extremely dangerous weapon falling into unknown hands." This development comes after Esteriore recently provoked Samsonia3, prior to the agreement, without NOPS approval.
