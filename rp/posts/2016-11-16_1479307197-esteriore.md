# GEN: Marion Responds to critics

Nations involved: Esteriore

Prime minister of Esteriore, Carver Marion, has been responding to critics of his methods of handling yesterday's crisis.

"I fully understand the critics of my methods. I waited until the very last minute to make a move and take power, I killed a man in the process, and I locked up politicians and drained their funds. But this is for a much larger cause. If it weren't for me, we would probably be at war right now. Millions would have died in the process, nations destroyed and economies crippled. I probably could have taken power in a less bloody way and much earlier on, as there were immense protests against the war in Habna, but I never thought It would have escalated to the level we saw tomorrow. In the end, you should all be quite grateful our country is not run by a megalomaniac with a thirst for blood".
