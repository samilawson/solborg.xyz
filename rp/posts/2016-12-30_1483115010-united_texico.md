Posted by: united_texico

Nations involved: United Texico, North American countries

United Texico announced that the Trans-American Oil Pipeline has been suspended indefinitely due to a lack of interested countries. 

A spokesman for the government stated that the country will focus on working with Mandalae in constructing the Trans-America Railway. He also stated that the government is aware of the global environmentalist backlash against the pipeline initiative and will sought to expand other sectors of its economy, such as the Information Technology industry. The Chuck Chong administration hopes that the country can cooperate with other countries who specialise in said industry, including Amenembourg, New Nexon and Solborg.
