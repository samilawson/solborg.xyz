# DIPLOMACY: Socialist Compact

Posted by: the_berniereich

Nations involved: The Berniereich, European Bolsheviks

The Berniereich and European Bolsheviks (People's Republic on Discord) have reached an agreement to further unite our socialist economies. From now on we will share a common market and a common set of state-sponsored parts. Any other nations willing to join the Socialist Compact are welcomed.
