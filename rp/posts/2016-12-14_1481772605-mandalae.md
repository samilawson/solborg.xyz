Posted by: mandalae

Nations involved: Mandalae, Esteriore

The President of Mandalae, Joseph Hagden, personally called the PM of Esteriore to thank him for his help in apprehending the terrorists responsible for a car bombing as well as a hostage situation. The terrorists will be tried, and without a doubt, convicted in court.

President Hagden also addressed the concerns over the Esterian Secret Police, saying, "If the authoritarian and deeply theocratic government of Al Ghaza can be a recognized member of NOPS, an institution that attempts to maintain the democratic values that we all hold dear, then Esteriore can do as they please with their intelligence gathering. I have no doubt that Esteriore can use this force to uphold the civil liberties and personal freedoms that are the bedrock of our society."
