Posted by: mandalae

Nations involved: Mandalae

The Mandalaean presidential election will be held tomorrow, the first Monday of January 2017. The race features three notable candidates: incumbent Joseph Hagden of the ODU, Cynthia Garfield of the LUP, and Andrew Mardon of the NCP.

President Hagden is expected to win in a landslide.

Also, the congress will be holding its elections tomorrow. Again, president Hagden's party is expected to at least hold their seats, if not gain more. However, the Fascist Party is expected to gain some momentum because of the recent immigration policies of president Hagden.
