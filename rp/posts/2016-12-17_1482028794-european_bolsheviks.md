Nations involved: European Bolsheviks, Fascist Adrea

As a result of continued Adrean aggression against the People's Republic, and given the defeat of Georgekenia, the Revolutionary Worker's Council has seized the opportunity to invade its southern Fascist Neighbor before all Adrean forces return from fighting in North Africa.

60,000 troops, which were stationed along the wall separating Adrea and European Bolsheviks, have crossed the border and entered Adrean territory following direct orders from Party Leader Pyotr Arashenko. 

The Revolutionary Worker's Council has postponed the Labor Lottery indefinitely and it has issued that all citizens residing in European Bolsheviks' southern region are to relocate into the north in order for the Revolutionary Army to fortify the country in the event of Adrean retaliation. 

The country intends to proceed in accordance with the Military Calculator.
