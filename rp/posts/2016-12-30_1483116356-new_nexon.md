The historical wedding of His Imperial Majesty Emperor Slender of Nexon and Her Imperial Majesty Empress Aulmerri of Hiachijan is expected to start soon.

The wedding ceremony will be held at the Throne Hall of the Imperial Palace of Nexon (which is also known by the name 'Palace of Eternal Harmony'). After that, a wedding reception will be held at the dining halls of the palace during which an elaborate six-course dinner will be served to all guests, along with sparkling champagne. The Imperial Nexonan Military Band, along with several renowned opera singers, will be entertaining the guests for the duration of the reception. 

After the meal has ended, guests will be allowed to roam around sections of the palace which are opened to the guests. A spectacular firework display will be witnessed at the lush palace gardens by the guests near midnight in order to commence 2017 AD, the year of the rooster in Nexonan mythology.
