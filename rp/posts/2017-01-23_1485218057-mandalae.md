Posted by: mandalae

Nations involved: Mandalae

The Mandalaean Secretary of Transportation, Victoria Hives, has just announced that she will be stepping down from her position due to an ongoing corruption scandal.

The scandal was centered around Hives' lack of action in expanding public bus and metro service in major cities, found to have been caused by the Mandalaean auto industry's donations to her.

The public outcry over Hives' corruption was met with swift action by the Hagden administration, who announced that Hives would be stepping down as soon as tomorrow.

Hives, a Neo-Conservative, was one of the few right leaning leaders in the government. Her replacement will be announced in the coming days.
