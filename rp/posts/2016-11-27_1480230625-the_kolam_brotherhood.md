Posted by: the_kolam_brotherhood

Nations involved: The Kolam Brotherhood, my puppets Anglynd and Syltar, Violetist Nations

Today, November 27th marks the death of Xustyl Kolins, the 2nd Prime Minister of the Kolam Brotherhood. Struck by a throwing knife, the Prime Minister was struck and killed while visiting a biosuit lab on a small island in the Aleutians. Although the Kolam Brotherhood has been thriving recently, a few terrorism groups have appeared after the recent events in the Middle East. Officials think that these terrorists are mainly radical Violetists. Luckily, the Republic of Anglynd has come to take control of the government, and run things before another election. The Kolam Brotherhood is still watchful as the transition may not be as smooth as they want it. The Kolam Brotherhood urges any nations willing to help contain terror to do so, no matter where they are or how they are doing it.
