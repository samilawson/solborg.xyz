After the announcement of the Trans-American Oil Pipeline Initiative, Tulsakastani Secretary of Trade John Blake released an official statement.

"Why don't y'all bring part of that sum'bich o'er here?", Blake eloquently asked. "We got plenty o' folk fixin' to get their hands on some work, and we plenty oil, too. Heck, we even got some coal down in McAlester, if y'all's feelin' particularly hungry."

Tulsakastan has been noted for its strong conservative ideology, deep-rooted Christian theocracy, decentralized government, and questionable human rights record. 

Nevertheless, it's still proven to have blue-collar laborers and natural resources abundant, a leading source of pollution and lung cancer around the area.
