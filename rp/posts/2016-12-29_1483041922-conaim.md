Posted by: conaim

Nations involved: Conaim, Utah (formerly), New Nexon, Mandalae, Esteriore, New Texico

"It's the least I could do for the people who nailed the last nail on the coffin of Utah" he stated in a press meeting

"in other news the province Mormon Country, once all mormons are on Baffin Island as Esteriore planned, I have made my own plan to create a new Provence in Mormon Country's place based on the city of West New York."
In honor of our allies, it shall be called Manestono
a combination of Mandalae, Esteriore, New Nexon, and New Texicos' names.

The president also advises Esteriore to occupy the Mormon settlement on Baffin Island, as the mormons were pushed pash the point of resentment a long time ago and keeping them at bay until they give up forever is more important.
