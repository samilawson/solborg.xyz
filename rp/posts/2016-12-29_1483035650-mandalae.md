# TAR: Mandalae and United Texico Begin Railway Construction

Posted by: mandalae

Nations involved: Mandalae, United Texico

Although both Mandalae and United Texico are currently constructing a massive oil pipeline between the two countries, a new high-speed rail system, dubbed "the Trans-American Railway" has begun construction.

The railway will branch all across the northwest from Mandalae's capital, Santandem, to United Texico, and is expected to haul thousands of people each day across the continent.
