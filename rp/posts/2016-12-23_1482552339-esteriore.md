# GEN: Plans Sped Up

Posted by: esteriore

Nations involved: Esteriore, Solborg, New Woking, Hispatia

The recent intel leaks from Solborg have forced the Esterian government to speed up several secret plans concerning the Panama Canal and New Woking.

Troops have begun marching into New Woking to occupy the country in order to construct an extremely crucial oil pipeline that will supply the country with fossil fuels for years to come. At this point, 2 towns have been occupied.

Several Aircraft carriers and Battleships in the Carribean have now been given the order to block off the Panama Canal trade route in Hispatia.

Non-violent solutions, however, are also options. In New Woking's case, all they simply have to do is allow the recent:y proposed oil pipeline to be built through the country. 15% of all profits from the oil will also be given to them. In Hispatia's case, they must give total administrative permissions over the Panama Canal to Esteriore. Until decisions are taken, trade will continue in Hispatia, and troops will remain still in New Woking.
