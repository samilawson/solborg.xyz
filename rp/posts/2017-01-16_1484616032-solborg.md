Posted by: solborg

Nations involved: Solborg, Kievinki, ISV

At 02:47 Eastern European Time, officers from the Solborgian SBP stormed an apartment in Vasa after the Stasäpo received an anonymous tip regarding the whereabouts of the two suspected terrorists from the bombing in Uleåborg, Kievinki. In the apartment, the police encountered two men. One was arrested and the other was killed.

Representatives of the police have declined to comment on the specifics of the situation, but the man who was killed is confirmed to have been armed. If the suspects are confirmed to have been involved in the Uleåborg attacks, they will face trial and sentencing in Solborg due to the government's policy forbidding extradition to countries with the death penalty.
