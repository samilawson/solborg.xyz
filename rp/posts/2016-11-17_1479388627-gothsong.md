Nations involved: Kingdom of Gothsong, Odenreig, Nerisis

17.11.2016
The leader of Gothsong (King Laguce V) in his public speech yesterday decided that he will arm the demilitarized island of Malta with nuclear weapons and/or other weapons of mass destruction.

While King himself said that the WMDs will be kept in the island to keep the nation safe, the national newspaper is more than sure that they are used to threaten Nerisis and more importantly Odenreig.
