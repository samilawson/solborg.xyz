# FA: Adrea denounces the Bolsheviks, praises Samsonia3

Posted by: fascist_adrea

Nations involved: Fascist Adrea, European Bolsheviks, Samsonia3

Iaerme Pales has come out with a statement, saying that she "praises the comendable actions" taken by Samsonia3. However, she calls the Bolsheviks "complete and utter liars, who are using a misunderstanding to benefit themselves at the cost of their people's rational thought" 

She states that in one week, a lend-lease of FAMA small arms and artillery, some of the newest and best technology in their areas, will be sent to Samsonia3, unless they deny or close the deal.

Adrea has begun to build defenses along its border with the Bolsheviks, in the case that the, in Iaerme's words "Psychotic, idiotic, and plainly bigoted administration" of the E.B. decide that a war will be the only reasonable reaction to such an insult.
