# TERRITORY: Mixed feelings in Conaim

Posted by: conaim

Nations involved: Conaim, Imperial Canada

Much to the dismay of 48% of Conaim, The nation had voted to annex the land to the north, however Imperial Canada swooped in and took over the North territory before Conaim could do the same so the nation wouldn't expand after all. This angered 52% of Conaim slightly but not too much while the other 48% rejoiced that Conaim would remain as the way it was, the 48% thought that new land would mess up Conaim's shape and equilibrium. Either way there are no harsh feelings against the Canadians.
After all, Conaim was originally founded to protect the land it had, not to expand.
