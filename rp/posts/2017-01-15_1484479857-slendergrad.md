# WAR: Slendergradian Government Requests Humanitarian Council's Withdrawal

Posted by: slendergrad

Nations involved: Slendergrad, Imperial Canadian Union, New Nexon (minor)

With the thinly-spread violence in the country ended, the Slendergradian government requests for the humanitarian council led by the Imperial Canadian Union to leave the country. 

"Damages are only contained to the rural areas in which the Slenderofascists took up arms, while the territories held by the traitor Evan Lee were secured after his execution without much of a fight. As our government is now firmly established, we are capable of repairing the damages caused and resettling those who are displaced. We thank the council for taking care of our fellow Slendergradians but it is time for the government to take responsibility over their well-being," President Archer Lee said in a press conference, his first since the uprising ended. 

In addition, he also stated that foreign media has over-exaggerated on the 'nation-wrecking' damages caused and the 'state of anarchy' in this 'war'. He firmly stated that the damages caused by the 'two uprisings' (two words which he strongly emphasised on) are contained in the 'rural areas where the Slenderofascists rebelled' (again, those words are emphasised). Even then, the Slenderofascist disturbance is 'thinly spread'. 

Intelligence agents from Nexon, who were stationed at this former colony, have confirmed that the President's words are true but they weren't certain on exactly how he would "take responsibility for their (Slendergradians) well-being".
