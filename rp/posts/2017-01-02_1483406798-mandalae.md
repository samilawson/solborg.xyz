# ELECTION AND REVOLT: Mandalaean Election Results Spark Chaotic Revolt

Posted by: mandalae

Nations involved: Mandalae

CHAOS! Mandalae's elections have just concluded, and, as predicted, Joseph Hagden has been re-elected president. His party, the ODU, also picked up 3 seats in the congress.

However, this is not the biggest news following the election. The far-right Fascist Party gained 21 seats, nearly double what was expected. Not only that, but a group of militants in the province of New Harrison have declared themselves independent of Mandalae, and are currently trying to take the city of Zorfum from the government.

Although Fascist Party officials have not yet commented on the revolt, the other right-wing parties (which were largely damaged in the election by the increase in popularity of the Fascist Party) were quick to condemn the rebels.

Although liberals across the nation are rejoicing at president Hagden's victory, their celebration is marked by the shock of these recent events.

More to come.
