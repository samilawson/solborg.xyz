Posted by: magnificent_wadiya

Nations involved: All

The Ministry of Finance has announced that it will be opening up Magnificent Wadiya's borders to more foreign investors interested in extracting crude oil in the East African Republic. 

Many previously undiscovered oil reserves in Magnificent Wadiya were located by Geologists last year, and until now only a few national enterprises and foreign companies have been permitted to access a small amount of sites. 

However, given the excessive economic potential burried beneath the surface, Admiral General Aladeen has drafted plans to increase the presence of foreign governments and companies in Magnificent Wadiya. 

He envisions a prosperous future in which Magnificent Wadiya and all its Business Partners can share success through international trade and diplomacy.

For additional information regarding the several advantages and the process of operating in Magnificent Wadiya, potential investors can refer to the Factbook entry on Crude Oil and Petroleum.
