Dick Tator-
"Look, I don't hate Cacusians, I just can't tolerate anyone who is a remote threat even by just a little bit, Frjed's remains will go home if he actually has a family as the Cacusian government insisted...but first there will be investigation, if he is really a spy Cacusia might as well say now."

The remains are said to be sent to Frjed's possible family in around a week or so.
