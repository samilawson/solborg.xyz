Nations involved: Austrian Habsburgs, Hiachijan, New Nexon

Austrian Habsburg Prime Minister Karl Fischer has announced that he will be attending the wedding of Empress Aulmerri of Hiachijan and Emperor Slender of New Nexon on December 29th in Khyren.

He enthusiastically stated at a press conference that he wishes "to celebrate this marvelous unity" and to "establish better relations between Austrian Habsburgs and American Nations."  

Following the announcement, a small group of Hard-line secularists protested in front of Parliament to voice their discontent with Karl Fischer's decision.

"Austrian Habsburgs perpetuates its dark catholic past of religious ceremonies by supporting marital bondages between oppressive foreign dignitaries" said Jamila Ackerman, spokesperson for No-Church-4-U.
