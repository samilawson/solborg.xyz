# WAR: Centralstan Airstrike Reparation Demands

Posted by: vaegir-swadia

Nations involved: Vaegir-Swadia

In light of the recent events in the Cacusian Colony, I present the following demands to Centralstan:

1. One billion Denars shall be paid to the government of Vaegir-Swadia to reconstruct the base and replace the killed forces.
2. 500 Million total shall be paid to the families of those killed and injured by the airstrike.
3. One billion shall be given to humanitarian aid programs for nations afflicted by the NLA.

If Centralstan fails to pay these reparations, Vaegir-Swadia is prepared to engage in armed conflict.

Signed,
King James Tiberius Sargoth of Vaegir-Swadia
Supreme Marshal Irons of the Vaegir-Swadian Military
