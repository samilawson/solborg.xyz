Posted by: fascist_adrea

Nations involved: Adrea, Wedding

Iaerme Pales, visibly giddy over plans for the World Fair, has come out with a statement that she will be attending the wedding, using it as a position to contact other world leaders and make a show of Adrean glory, by committing 1/20th of the Adrean army to make a ceremonial march and festivity during the wedding, as well as having officers and generals attend. Along with the force, Iaerme will be bringing her massive bodyguard force, ensuring everyone's safety.

Iaerme, known to be a sucker for schmaltz and gowns, is noticeably excited, commanding a monument be built in Firz in honor of the wedding.
