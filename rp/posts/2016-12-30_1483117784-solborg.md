In response to the recent attack in Afghanipakijikistan, the Parliament of Solborg has ordered a temporary suspension of all immigration into the country. The restrictions are expected to ease if the referendum to establish a Board of Immigration Security passes after the elections on 15 January. Current pollsters estimate there is a 98% chance of the measure passing.

The Parliament has also reaffirmed its stance on accepting refugees. The Speaker of Parliament said earlier today, "We must help those who genuinely need help, while still taking the necessary measures to ensure security and smooth integration. Asylum seekers who are admitted will be vetted, housed among Solborgians, and required to learn Swedish. Of course some individuals in the Muslim community express backwards views that do not line up with our modern society, and we must make it clear that those views will not be tolerated in Solborg. However, to make blanket statements about all Muslims is not only incorrect but counterproductive."
