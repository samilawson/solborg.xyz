# GEN: Betiutia does not have nuclear weapons.

Posted by: solborg

Nations involved: Solborg, Ellenstedt, Betiutia

Betiutia, who previously claimed to be arming middles with nuclear warheads, has been found not to have any nuclear weapons or any technology to build them. This conclusion has been reached after a joint Solborgian-Ellenstedtian intelligence investigation. Sanctions are still likely because of the chemical weapons.
