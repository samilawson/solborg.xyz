Nations involved: Conaim, Vladimirstan

Some observances from Smith City and West New York have inferred a Mormon radical army being built in the Provence and Conaim urges its neighbor Vladimirstan to check its Utah territory for any changes.

Conaim is going to commence millitray exercises in the northeast part of the country, meanwhile more protection will be set up for Ellen and the rest of New Columbia.
