# SPACE: Europa-Enceladus Rockets launched!

Posted by: skolborg_space_initiative

Nations involved: Skolborg Space Initiative

This morning on the island of Barbados, the unmanned project to Europa and Enceladus rockets have been launched. But the greatest surprise TV spectators in Skolborg received was not the launch, but the time for the rocket to arrive in Jupiter. 31 days! Science fiction, would say many, when the predictions were of rather 2 years to reach the Jovenian system. But the Initiative seemed to have kept a secret: Ion B propulsion. Since three years the Initiative has been secretly investigating the power of Ionic propulsion. On earth and in any atmosphere containing ions this isn't possible, so a conventional rocket will send the travelling spacecraft to Low Earth Orbit. Is is only from there that the ionic engine will be opened and launched, in a couple of hours. Which leads to the uplifting fact that was transmitted on TV over all Skolborg: We will be on Europa on Christmas day!
