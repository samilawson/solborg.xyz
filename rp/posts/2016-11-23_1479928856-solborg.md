# ALLIES: Military Base in Cagliari

Posted by: solborg

Nations involved: Solborg, Ellenstedt, Odenreig, NOPS

Solborg and Ellenstedt are funding the conversion of an airport in Cagliari, Odenreig into a military base for NOPS to grant easy access to the western Mediterranean. NOPS nations may fly their troops to the base via plane and take a ship to target locations in the Mediterranean. This is especially useful during the ongoing Samsonia3 conflict.

The Solborgian military is also converting old Boeing 747s into military transport planes. They can carry up to 600 soldiers per flight. NOPS nations interested in purchasing them may contact Solborg.
