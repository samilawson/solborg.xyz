Nations involved: Fascist Athena

The Department of Domestic operations has announced that it has "mysteriously" lost track of nearly 1,000 Afghanipakijikistani refugees inside Fascist Athena.

When asked about the anomaly, Secretary of Domestic Operations Nicolas Alexei stated that "It is truly puzzling, however I am certain that all refugees in Fascist Athena are secure and well-kept. Our flexibility with these people is a testimony to our charitable and compassionate government."

Whilst the press conference was taking place, an ominous fleet of black trucks escorted by military vehicles left the Department of Safety. Pedestrians watched in awe as the convoy drove through Thessaloniki, before disappearing on the horizon.
