# WOV: The Enlightened Reaction of Iaerme Pales, Long May She Reign, In Accordance To Criminal Attacks In New Oslo

Posted by: fascist_adrea

Nations involved: Fascist Adrea, New Telemark

Earlier today, a massive scale attack in New Oslo went under way, in which many were killed, and the Warriors of Violet had become a part of the world stage and its politics. Iaerme was informed of the situation immediately after waking up, and had called for a massive broadcast of an impromptu speech prepared in only 10 minutes.

FANN televised the speech, as well as whatever footage it could acquire of the event for the remainder of the day. The already massively militarized state of Adrea is said to be mobilizing its forces, most specifically the FAIC special forces, preparing to begin a Gunboat Diplomacy stance to the situation.

Iaerme was quoted as saying "We will not allow such a tragedy to occur at any location in the world, least of all in Telemark, an idol society."

Many Adreans are now fearing a possible attack in Firz, or any other large city, as per the massively Atheist and Secular policies that rule much of the nation without fault.
