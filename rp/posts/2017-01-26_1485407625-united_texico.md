After the results of the referendum were out, the Constituion has been amended so that the President could only serve two terms consecutively. The term length is still 7 years. When interviewed by reporters, President Chuck Chong said that he'll probably take a break from politics by taking a trip around the world after serving two terms and that he might run for the Presidency if the country ever needs him. The President was confident that he would be able to serve for another term as his approval rating is currently at 83%, among the highest ever enjoyed by preceding presidents.
