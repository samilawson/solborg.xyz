Posted by: new_nexon

Nations involved: New Nexon, Amenembourg 

His Imperial Majesty Emperor Slender has issued a statement to reassure the capitalists of Amenembourg that the country is protecting, and will always protect, the interests of the businesspeople.

"The current anti-corruption campaign does not seek to destroy the spirit of free enterprise. Rather, it seeks to clamp down on those who gained an unfair advantage over their competitors via government connection. If the Amenembourgians really do care about capitalism and free market, they should be standing on the government's side."

In addition, many corporate figures in the country have also shown support for the Emperor's campaign as they were tired of some competitors' unfair advantages over the market, which led to a decline in economic efficiency.
