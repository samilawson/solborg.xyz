# WAR: Mandalae Joins Esteriore in War with European Bolsheviks

Posted by: mandalae

Nations involved: Mandalae, Esteriore, Fascist Adrea, European Bolsheviks

Mandalae, just after having founded the North American League, has chosen to join Esteriore (the country's closest ally) in the fight against the European Bolsheviks.

Mandalaean troops are landing in Esterian-held Fascist Adrea as we speak, including the 8th, 5th, and 2nd WROM battalions. Each battalion consists of 80 tanks, 40 AFVs, and 10,000 men. 

Also, the Mandalaean Air Force will begin conducting airstrikes on major Bolshevik centers once the recent cease fire is lifted. The aircraft will be launched from the WRS New Harrison (one of Mandalae's two aircraft carriers), as well as from landing strips within Adrea already held by Esteriore.

This is a major development in the fight against the Bolsheviks, and could be the final blow to the already weakened nation.
