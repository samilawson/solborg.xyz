# DIPLOMACY: Cacusia up and running

Posted by: democratic_republic_of_cacusia

Nations involved: Cacusia, Afghanipakijikistan, Centralstan, Vaeger-Swadia

Cacusia has reactivated its defense forces and they are fighting the NLA. Cacusia will open up peace talks with Afghanipakijikistan and Centralstan to make peace, rebuild, and destroy the NLA, with the help of Vaeger-Swadia. Peace talks will commence after all the parties involved agree. Hopefully we will achieve all these gals soon. Chancellor Alfapenguice has emerged from the capitol and emergency elections are taking place to fill the post of killed or incapacitated politicians. Kitt Zannah will resume his post as the Chacellors second in a few weeks as soon as he is out of the hospital. He is badly burned and scarred and will never walk again but his mind is intact and he can still speak. He wishes to wear a mask to hide his scarring from the public. the mask will be fashioned like Chancellor Alfapenguice's  helmet. The government will be fully functional in a few days.
