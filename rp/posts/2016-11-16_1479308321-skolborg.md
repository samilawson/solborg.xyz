# ECO: Beaverton calls for Environmental Treaty

Posted by: skolborg

Nations involved: All

In reaction to the recent natural disasters in Halvarda and Solborg, and in fear that these events will be more and more frequent, as well as in fear of the other possible impacts of climate change and environment indifferent policies, Laura Yate, Minister for Environment of Skolborg, addressed a speech to all all Norrlandic Nations, announcing “It is a widely accepted fact that our planet is drastically changing, and that we have, to a certain extent, a responsibility in this change. It is only by working with all Norrlandic nations together that we will have a chance to address this concern  and thus avoid to millions lives of suffering, destruction and death.” And  inviting delegations of every Norrlandic nation to Beaverton for an environmental conference which would, in case of success, lead to a Norrlandic Treaty addressing not only climate change but urbanisation, food and water supply, ecosystems and more environmental concerns.
