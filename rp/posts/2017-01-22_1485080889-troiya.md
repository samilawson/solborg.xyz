# WAR: Troiya surrenders

Posted by: troiya

Nations involved: Troiya, NOPS, NAL, other nations on New Yorkia's side

After Mandalaean and New Nexonan troops helped free Borneo and Troiya lost control of it's islands in the arctic, Vladimir I abdicated and Troiya surrendered. Troiya and the main nations in the war are currently discussing peace treaty terms. The newly elected Troiyan Prime Minister, Seryogin Klavdiy Yurievich, has made a speech.

"This is a dark time for us. Vladimir I had dragged us down into a war nobody asked for and now almost all of Norrland has declared war on our nation. Even our allies have turned against us. I declare that we shall be surrendering for the protection of the Troiyan people, as I know that if we continued the war the NOPS and NAL forces would not be forgiving. I, hopefully, will be setting up the Republic of Troiya. Thank you."
