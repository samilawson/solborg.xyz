# WAR: Mandalae Ramps up Offensive in Borneo

Posted by: mandalae

Nations involved: Troiya, New Nexon, NOPS

In tandem with New Nexonan forces in the Troiyan colony of Borneo, Mandalae has stepped up its offensive.

Although the majority of Mandalean forces have yet to arrive from New Yorkia, a small group of around 500 Mandalaean Rangers, the most elite troops in the country, were deployed to assist rebel groups on the island. Naval forces on the coast have also started bombarding further inland targets in coordination with the offensive.

Borneo is expected to be under Mandalaean/Nexonan occupation by the beginning of next week if this new plan goes well.
