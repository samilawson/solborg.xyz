# MORMON WAR: Stalemate battle in Mormon Country

Posted by: conaim

Nations involved: Conaim, Utah, Vladimirstan 

Due to supplies free lying crossing into Utah from Vladimirstan, Mormons have been able to make this war hard, as a costly stalemate battle has occurred at a halfway point between West New York and Smith City,

The battle of halfway point has been the worst in Conaim's history with around 5,000 killed today on both sides.

Even with all these helpful nations attacking the sons of Utah, the war won't easily be won unless Vladmimirstan attacks Utah.
