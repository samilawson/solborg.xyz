# GEN: Esteriore elects new leader!

Posted by: esteriore

Nations involved: Esteriore

Esteriore has just elected a new leader! Bruno Pesce won the general election in a landslide win (73,8%).

He promises to make diplomatic ties with other Norrlandic nations, Solborg in particular, as relations with them have been quite bumpy recently. He will prioritize more extensive civil and political rights, and remove some restrictions on the economy, allowing for more investments abroad.
