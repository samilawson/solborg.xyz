# GEN: Election Cycle Sped Up

Posted by: esteriore

Nations involved: Esteriore

After much thought, Esterian Prime Minister Carver Marion has decided to speed up the election cycle, by holding the election in 30 minutes. Citizens and vote counters are scrambling to get to the viting booths in time, and the largest cities in the country are in absolute chaos.

The PM justifies this by saying he does not want to give the communist party a chance in this election, as he thinks the economy will be ruined by it. People are split on the issue, but either way, the election is happening in 30 minutes.

Candidates are Federal Michela Caravello and Socialist Giovanni Vatalaro. Well, those are the candidates that have a chance of winning, at least. They are currently campaigning for the last 30 minutes, hoping to win a couple more votes. An important statement, however, was made by Michela Caravello. She said that she will work her hardest to establish relations with Skaan, after reading the newspaper this morning. 

Nations are encouraged to show their support for the candidates. The Federal Party promises more extensive foreign policy, more autonomy for states and a larger army, while the socialists promise focus on domestic affairs and Social Housing, a better healthcare system and more welfare.
