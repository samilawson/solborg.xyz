Raikkonia has published a plan in a closed-door meeting to ensure the safety of civilians.

They have offered services ranging from dropping supplies in war-torn cities all the way to establishing emergency shelters for civilians.

Diplomat Tuomas Ilmari has cautioned that soldiers and other political figures will be denied direct assistance.

"We're not creating alliances," he said. "We don't want anything misrepresented as assisting the war effort. We simply want to ensure the safety of the citizens without affecting the war in the slightest."
