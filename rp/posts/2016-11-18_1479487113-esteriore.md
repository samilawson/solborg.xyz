# GEN: Final Warning to Nuclear WSCN Nations

Posted by: esteriore

Nations involved: WSCN Members, NOPS Members, 

Concerning the recent tensions caused by Samsonia3, Esteriore has decided to Kick them out.

"Let this be a warning to nations of the WSCN. Any nuclear weapon holders will be kicked out if they escalate tensions. Samsonia invaded an island near Gothsong, and built nuclear  weapons without permission of a single WSCN nation". Says Joseph Dubois, General secretary of the WSCN. 

"We have already demanded that Samsonia disposes of their nuclear weapons in these times, and they have refused to respond. If they continue to escalate tensions, troops will be sent to secure the weapons by force".
