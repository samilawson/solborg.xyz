# WAR: Battle of Baja, European Bolshevik Party makes Nuclear Threat

Posted by: european_bolsheviks

Nations involved: European Bolsheviks, Fascist Adrea, Esteriore

The Esterian military has commenced its assault on the small Bolshevik-held town of Baja in Adrea's Northern Region. 
 
The swift and formidable attack by the Esterian Airforce left 2,431 European Bolsheviks dead and an additional 5,780 wounded. 

The Revolutionary Army has abandoned its presence in Fascist Adrea, and has retreated to the border town of Kiskunhalas in the PREB's southern region. 

400,000 reserves have reached the position of the initial troops, and the military has begun to heavily fortify its position. 

All European Bolshevik missile systems, except for a few, have been sent to the south in order to protect the Motherland from further advancement by the enemy. 

Generals are predicting that the next battle will be the bloodiest of the war, referring to Kiskunhalas as the "PREB's Stalingrad." 

According to the R.A.D.I. (Revolutionary Army Department for Information), if Kiskunhalas were to fall, the Revolutionary Army would likely have to retreat all the way to Budapest.

In the wake of these harrowing reports, Pyotr Arashenko stated at the European Bolshevik Party Headquarters that "the PREB will not shy away from the use of W.M.Ds."
