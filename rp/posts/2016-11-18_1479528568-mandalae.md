# NMC: Proposed Trans-Mandalae Roadway

Posted by: mandalae

Nations involved: Mandalae

The Mandalaean government's new infrastructure plan includes the blueprints for a proposed Trans-Mandalae Roadway system, which would start in the city of Haddleburg, snaking its way north along Mandalae's coast to the capital, Santandem, and then ending in the city of Truckee in the very north of the country. It will also branch off into the cities of Damstern, Placer City, and Barker Pass.
