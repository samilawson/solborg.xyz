# INTERNAL: Royal family back on throne

Posted by: united_netherlands_and_belgium

Nations involved: United Netherlands and Belgium, New-Indochina, Victoria and Queensland

The citizens of United Netherlands and Belgium have, with help of the New-Indochinese Military, helped the Royal Family back on the throne (Von Nassau-Schlieffen).


The old Government, including the monarchy, was overthrown by a Marxist-Leninist Communist party, banning the Royal Family to Victoria and Queensland.

As the communists became more and more to a dictatorship, and people there were getting tired of the Federation's Communist Government, New-Indochina decided that there need to happen something.

The Navy started with attacks on the Royaume Palaice, the new Government building built by the Communists, and made the old Government building (Kremelijn Paleis) the palace of the President. The Royaume Palaice was destroyed shortly after the attacks. The Winter Palace of the President (or dictator) was being bombed by his own Air Force, with support of the Royal Indochinese Air Force. Shortly after, the Communist Government capitulated, creating a new democratic elected Government and giving the Royal Family the throne back.
