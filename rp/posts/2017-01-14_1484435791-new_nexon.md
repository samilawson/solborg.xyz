# GEN: NASC annexed to Nexonan Empire

Posted by: new_nexon

Nations involved: New Nexon, Nexonan Administrative Sphere of Canada

In the wake of the global recession, the Federation of Canada, a former Nexonan colony which became independent on 1987, defaulted on its debts (which was mostly owned by Nexon) and as a result had to ask them to bail them out. The Nexonan government has agreed, in exchange for their sovereignty. The country will now be renamed back to the Nexonan Administrative Sphere of Canada and be considered a part of Nexon.
