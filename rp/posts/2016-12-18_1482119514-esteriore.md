# WAR: Cyber Attack on Missile systems

Posted by: esteriore

Nations involved: Esteriore, NOPS, PREB

The Esterian Secret police has just launched a successful cyber attack on the European Bolshevik missile system, rendering the grand majority of missiles in the country totally unusable.

The system will remain blocked during peace talks with the Bolsheviks, as the Prime minister has accepted the offer to talk about a solution. They will be connecting to the country's leader via video chat, as there is no time to waste in flying to the country. 

All military operations will cease during the talks, as we cannot take any chances in this delicate situation. This does not mean the military is being any less attentive. They will continue to be on high alert until they recieve messages from high-ranking officials.
