Samsonia2's Satellite has dropped some kind of Dusty material all over Portmany! The dust is limiting visibility hugely, but there have not been explosions, indicating that the Satellite is not nuclear-armed, but the dust has been falling all over the place. The Satellite is now headed towards Samsonia2 and Morocco, and within 12 hours, have another chance to come across Europe. Samsonia3's higher-ranking soldiers have been equipped with gas masks with retinal enhancers to see through the dust as well as to not inhale any.
