Posted by: fascist_adrea

Nations involved: Fascist Adrea, Mandalae, Samsonia3

Adrean diplomats have thanked Mandalae for their support of Adrea, and have confirmed that Iaerme Pales herself will make an appearance at their celebration, bringing with her a large guard force and many Adrean delocacies. Iaerme herself, seen in Firz with a new scar presumably gained in battle against the Bolsheviks, stated that she is glad to usher in a period of peace after all the tumultuous fighting across Adrea.

Other diplomats, these in Samsonia3, have requested that either Samsonia dismantle the nuclear device, or have Adrea dismantle it.

In Hungary, many soldiers can be seen marching through Szeged and South Budapest, now just "Pest", bring cheered on by Pan-Adrean and Hungarian Nationalist crowds. Military Police have already apprehended many criminals and supporters of the old regime.
