Nations involved: Afghanipakijikistan, Al-Ghaza

One hour ago, terrorists attacked a local Bazaar in Afghanipakijikistan's southern city of Kandahar. 

The assailants overran police on duty using AK-47s and Suicide Vests, killing 32 and injuring an additional 100. 

Sheikh Muhammad Ameen, leader of a group of Violetist Sympathizers in Afghanipakijikistan's northern city Mazari Sharif, has claimed responsibility for the attack. The extermist group is blameworthy for another recent assault on a Government Office in Herat, which is still under siege at this moment. 

Amidst the rising fear of instability within government, Sultan Ahmed Abdullah Abu al-Fawaris has fled the country for Al-Ghaza.
