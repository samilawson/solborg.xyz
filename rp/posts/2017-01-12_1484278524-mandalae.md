# TRAIN: Mandalae and the Berniereich Begin Construction of Bering Strait Railway

Posted by: mandalae

Nations involved: Mandalae, the Berniereich

A proposed mammoth train system and bridge has just been agreed upon by both Mandalae and the Berniereich to connect both countries, and both continents.

Although extremely expensive, and undoubtedly time consuming, the Bering Railway (as it is being called) will officially connect Eurasia with the Americas for the first time since the continents separated millennia ago. 

Both Mandalae and the Berniereich have announced plans to develop joint territory, which they are dubbing "The Diomedes", on the islands of Little Diomede and Big Diomede in the middle of the Bering Strait. The train will pass through this territory.
