# COUNTER: Centralstan suprise air attack in colony is new Pearl Harbor some say

Posted by: centralstan

Nations involved: Centralstan, Afghanipakijikistan, Vaegir-Swadia, Cacusia

In defense of Afghanipakijikistan and to affirm itself in the region and furthermore to indirectly aid and protect itself, Centralstan doesn't officially declare war but rather aids Afghanipakijikistan against the European invaders.

Centralstan used its superior air force to launch a suprise attack on the Vaegir-Swadian air base as soon as planes left it to do their raid against Afghanipakijikistan. Let us clarify we don't actually believe in ISV, rather we find this offensive to our sphere of influence. The attack on the young Vaegir-Swadian air base was quick and totally destroyed it in a Pearl Harbor times 10. Centralstan will it bother attacking humanitarian camps unless the invaders steep low enough to use supplies from them.
