Nations involved: New Prussian Assembly

After many years of rule, Chancellor Heinrich von Podewils has died. He died in his sleep after a rather large foreign meal.

He has been replaced by Chancellor  Heinrich Friedrich Karl vom und zum Stein der große. We all hope for a long and prosperous reign!

As of now Chancellor Heinrich Friedrich Karl vom und zum Stein der große has yet to make any comment as to the current tensions throughout the world.

With the People for the Fatherland, Gott mit uns!
