# CANAL: Hispatian Military En Stand

Posted by: hispatia

Nations involved: Hispatia, NOPS, Stoichia, Hofsa, Esteriore, Solborg,

The Hispatian military has begun to patrol the borders, and has made a show of force through stationing the majority of the navy in the ports outlying the Canal, as well as many of the soldiers of the nation now holding the region. Due to the elections causing a lack of governing forces, the military is now acting independently and within the realm of Hispatian law. Diplomats have been sent to Esteriore to attempt a non-violent solution.

Ximena Florez, Head Admiral of Hispatia, has stated that after this event is cleared up, Esteriore will experience a heavy tax penalty on all trade ships and a tariff on all goods in Hispatia or passing through the Canal as reparation. Ximena, when asked by the press, was quoted as saying "I am certain that the situation will be solved without blood being shed."
