Nations involved: Mandalae, Conaim, Utah (unrecognized)

Mandalae's Defense Department just announced that the 1st battalion will be landing in Ellen, Conaim, and will then be sent to fight the violent Mormon extremists in the unrecognized state of Utah.

This announcement comes after Conaim's entry into the North American League, an alliance Mandalae helped to create.

Also, the national guard has been alerted of potential threats from Mormon terrorists within the country with help from Conaimese intelligence.
