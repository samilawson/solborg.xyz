With their classic rivalry once again entrancing the nation, Odarton has miraculously beaten AC Truckee!

No one thought it was possible, as Truckee's team has beaten Odarton in every game they've played in the past 5 seasons. However, that all came to an end, when Odarton's midfielder, Jamey Alvern, scored the winning goal in the last 30 seconds of extra time.

The score ended up being 3-2 Odarton, who look poised to win the National Championship this year.
