Nations involved: European Bolsheviks, Samsonia3

In response to recent reports of Samsonian mobilization and plans to attack the People's Republic, the Glorious Immortal Dear Leader Vladimir Ivanov gave a speech on European Bolshevik State Television regarding the situation.

He stated that "the People's Republic is merely setting up more effective defenses in the event of a strike by any nation, which in a likely scenario would come from an LRN member, given that this band of misfit nations has attacked the Socialist Worker's Republic before." 

He continued by saying that "the aggressive and feeble-minded politicians of Samsonia3 feel threatened by a peaceful Eastern European country taking defensive precautions, which clearly demonstrates their insufficient logistical capabilities and weakness."

The Glorious Immortal Dear Leader concluded his speech by pointing out that "the Revolutionary Army has fortified the country's borders and cities in a purely defensive manner, and now Samsonia3 is pointing missiles at us!? The Proletariat doesn't want a conflict, but if we must defend our nation from these war-pigs, then so be it!"
