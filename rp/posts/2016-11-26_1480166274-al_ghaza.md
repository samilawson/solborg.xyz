This morning at 5:02 AM GST, the government building in Tehran was ambushed by 23 trucks carrying rioters holding stones, sticks, and guns. The rioters proceeded to ram down the fence with a truck, and break into the building. Once they were in, in was an all out manslaughter, with 97 employees killed and 124 injured until the police had arrived. Many officers were killed, but they were able to stand their ground and take down the enemy fleet.

Investigators have looked into the scene, and have suggested that the hole in the wall was most likely caused by a high grade grenade launcher, a weapon that a rioter would not be able to obtain. The vehicles are being inspected for any more dangerous weaponry, and results of the full inspection will be released in the near future.
