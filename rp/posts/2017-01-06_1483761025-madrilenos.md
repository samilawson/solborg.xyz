Posted by: madrilenos

Nations involved: Madrilenos, all Socialist Countries

The Republic of Madrilenos has officially formed a union with the Eastern European People's Republic of European Bolsheviks, thereby establishing the International Socialist Union (ISU). 

The Alliance would provide a basis for far-left countries in Norrland to support each other economically and promote socialist ideas around the world.

"This Alliance will strengthen the relations between proletarian nations around the world, and bind together the average economies of socialist countries to form one powerful force on the international stage." said Fernandez Alejandro, Prime Minister of Madrilenos.

All far-left to center-left countries are invited into the union, which as Fernandez has guaranteed, will greatly benefit the world economy and empower the working class in states where until now, all hope seemed lost.
