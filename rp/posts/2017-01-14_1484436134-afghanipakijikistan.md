Posted by: afghanipakijikistan

Nations involved: Afghanipakijikistan, Cacusia (and colony)

Last week, Leader of the NAAV, Amir Bousaid, broadcasted a message on Baghlan and Kunduz television regarding the establishment a Cacusian colony to the East of Afghanipakijikistan.

He stated that "this is an obvious attempt by the west to use the civil war to their advantage in order to seize land that belongs to the Afghanis of the East and Pakistanis to the south."

Amir continued by saying that "we will strike fear into the hearts of our enemies, and then they will disperse like roaches!"

Additionally, ISV Leader Muhammad Abdullah Al-Safar in southern Kandahar Province also commented on the matter by declaring "holy war" on Cacusia.

However, before the radical extremist was able to conclude his threatening speech, he was escorted to a truck by other ISV members following a sudden nearby explosion detonated by Nationalist Forces.
