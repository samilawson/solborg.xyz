# ALLIANCES: Al Ghaza Withdraws From NOPS

Posted by: al_ghaza

Nations involved: Al Ghaza, NOPS

Al Ghazan Sultan Ali Bahkr announced withdrawl from NOPS this afternoon due to the increasing role they were faced with in the alliance due to the recent refugee crisis. While this seems like a positive event, it has lead to economic strain and the Ghazan economy can no longer have refugees pouring through its borders. Forces have reached the borders and will make sure no new refugees pass through them. As for Al Ghaza's future in foreign relations, negotiations with LRN are occurring now.
