Posted by: habna

Nations involved: Habna, everyone else

Habna is sorry for any misunderstanding as of recent,
Amaldrus did not actually launch a s shuttle to Mars today,
They accidentally broadcasted a simulation! 
What a laughing stock!
The EHSP will not be colonizing Mars for up to a year or so maybe.
In other News The Trans-Habnian Highway is actually still under constricting but it really has helped the areas its in recover from war poverty.
