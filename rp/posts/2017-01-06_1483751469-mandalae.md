# CIVIL WAR: Fascist Party Disbanded

Posted by: mandalae

Nations involved: Mandalae

After the recent Mandalaean Civil War, largely spurred by the success of the Fascist Party in the January 2nd election, the Fascist Party has officially been disbanded.

Since all of its representatives were either killed or have since been jailed on charges of treason, and the public were vehemently against such a treacherous and destructive party, president Hagden officially declared that the Fascist Party would no longer exist starting now.

A runoff election for each sitting member of the House who was in the Fascist Party will be held tomorrow. Most of the seats will likely go to the Social Conservatives.
