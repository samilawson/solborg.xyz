# EVENTS: Raikkonian Leader Visits Shinmin Winter Festival

Posted by: raikkonia

Nations involved: Raikkonia, Shinmin

Raikkonian leader Henri Saarinen-Korpela has recently been spotted in the Shinmin Prefecture as he attended the winter festival.

His arrival was unannounced to the public, and is another stop in recent festivities. Korpela was also spotted amongst a Solborg convoy headed towards the Mediterranean recently, although the full extent of this trip is unknown.

This all comes during the middle of Raikkonia's attempts to spread festivity, having done everything from hoisting a temporary flag at the capitol building to offering more foreign aid. 

Insiders say a response to Hurricane Nicolas might be arround the corner.
