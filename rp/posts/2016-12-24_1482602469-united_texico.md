# DIPLOMACY: Texico and NOPS Signed Partnership Pact

Posted by: united_texico

Nations involved: Texico, Solborg, Other NOPS members

Despite the fact that it's no secret Texico has always resented the NOPS for allegedly being dominated by European countries and allegedly extending European influence to North American countries such as New Telemark, Texican President Chuck Chong, who was just confirmed by Congress to be the official President as according to the constitution, and NOPS Secretary-General Jans Ã…kesson signed the Texican-NOPS Partnership Pact. Under the pact, Texico promises to assist the NOPS in maintaining peace and order in North America.
