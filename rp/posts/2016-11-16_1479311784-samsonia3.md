Posted by: samsonia3

Nations involved: Samsonia2, Samsonia3

Samsonia3 and the still-unnamed Supreme God-Emperor demands that Norrland accept its request to expand into Northern Africa. 
"We demand this land, as it rightfully belongs to us. We put our flag there first! If Norrland denies us this request, we shall have to occupy it with force!" - Supreme God-Emperor
Currently the land is largely uninhabited but provides a fertile area for certain crops.
