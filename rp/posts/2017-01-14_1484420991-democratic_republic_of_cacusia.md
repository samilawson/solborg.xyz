# TERRITOTY: Cacusian Colonization 

Posted by: democratic_republic_of_cacusia

Nations involved: Cacusia

Cacusia now has formed a colony in that includes Katmandu, the Himalayas, Lhasa and part of the Tibetan plateau. The colony is in a beautiful area and hopefully will bring more tourists to Cacusia, specifically climbers wishing to scale Mount Everest.
