Posted by: mandalae

Nations involved: Mandalae

Mandalae's new Main Battle Tank, the WR-8 (a) Cougar, began production in factories all across the nation on Tuesday. The tank is equipped with a highly advanced main armament (the 130mm M-2), as well as torsion bar suspension, a remote controlled rocket propelled grenade launcher, armor plating coated with the explosion-resistent metal, fardirminium, and a top speed of 68 km/h. The Cougar also has a 650 km range. 

Mandalae is expected to be equipped with at least 1,000 Cougars by March, eventually aiming for a steep goal of 7,000 tanks in total.

The Cougar will also be available for purchase outside of Mandalae to the members of the NOPS alliance, of which Mandalae is a part of. 

The new technology of this tank makes it one of, if not the fiercest on the market, and will undoubtedly give Mandalae and its allies the upper hand in any future conflicts.
