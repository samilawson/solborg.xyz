Posted by: solborg

Nations involved: Solborg, Al Ghaza, Betiutia, Georgekenia

Following today's meeting between the Ghazan Prime Minister, the Solborgian Prime Minister, the Secretary General of NOPS, and the Supreme Leader of Betiutia, the three nations have negotiated a diplomatic solution to the ongoing Jerusalem conflict. Before any of these terms take place, the Georgekenian navy must leave Ghazan waters and remove the blockade.

1. All existing troops must be withdrawn from the Jerusalem area. Nations with troops inside Al Ghaza or Betiutia must withdraw their troops as well.
2. The government of Betiutia shall dispose of any chemical weapons in its possession and submit to an inspection by an international third party to ensure its compliance.
3. Jerusalem shall be established as an international zone, led by a locally elected board, that is free to visitors from all faiths. A demilitarized zone shall be established on its borders with Betiutia.
4. Betiutia and NOPS may maintain a limited number of peacekeeping troops within the territory of Jerusalem.
