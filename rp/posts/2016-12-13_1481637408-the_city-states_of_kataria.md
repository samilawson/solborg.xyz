# PROLIFERATION: Katari Sattilites pick up something strange. 

Posted by: the_city-states_of_kataria

Nations involved: Kataria, Nerisis, Aldrea, Esteriore

The Department of Defense released a video to the press the morning taken over Aldrea 3 days ago. The video shows a large truck driven by someone in the black cloth uniform of the Nerisis military stopping at the border and meeting with some Aldrean officials. When the contents of the truck were revealed it appeared to be a nuclear missile and on the side was a painting of a flag that looks like Esteriore leading us to believe it may be stolen from them. This follows the government intercepting telegrams between Nerisis and an unknown nation's government about a contract. More on this story as it continues.
