Posted by: habna

Nations involved: Habna

The rebel army of southern Haban has realized it is going to lose, and has gathered together to make one last huge suicide strike in the government, their plan; break through the barricade into the safer territory, planning to kill as many people as possible.
But the federal army is ready to put them down on their way to Arisap.
The federal government has also made sure that in the rare case they somehow broke through the barrier that there are units in the north to defend nuclear silos.
Premier Moah seems to be convenced the rebels will certainly loose.
