Nations involved: European Bolsheviks, LRN, Troyia

Following fierce discussion among European Bolshevik Party officials, the Immortal Dear Leader has wisely announced that the People's Republic plans to improve Diplomatic relations between the humble republic and LRN member nations. The Immortal Dear Leader stated on official state news that "we are thrilled to put past differences aside for now, in order to take a higher path and pursue common goals. We believe that if the People's Republic of European Bolsheviks is admitted into the LRN, it could greatly benefit trade and prosperous commerce between historical foes."

Additionally, in response to a recent ultimatum by the NOPS, the Immortal Dear Leader has declared that "we would like suspend any cooperation with NOPS for now. Our illustrious people have already began to dispose of the nuclear wastes with high regard for environmental conservation." Regarding Nuclear Energy, the Immortal Dear Leader said that "the People's Republic will develop alternative energy sources until a successful and internationally accepted Nuclear program is established."
