Nations involved: New Woking, Esteriore

In a recent discussion amongst the cabinet, the government has decided to lift the ban placed towards Esterians living in New Woking.

The board voted in a 52% victory for the Esterians, after a week of observations and debates about the current political position of the nation.

"Esteriore is still a trigger-happy nation that needs to be under strict observation." The Prime Minister speaks out. "It may be years before the citizens of New Woking change their minds, but for now the ban was barely lifted, and now we must work together to ensure that our nation's best interests are put first."

N.W. Population 21/11/2016: 27,100,000. (<1000 Esterians)
Estimated Population 02/01/2017: 28,500,000 (<10,000 Esterians)
