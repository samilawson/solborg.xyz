# WAR: Imperial Canadian Mobilization 

Posted by: imperial_canadian_union

Nations involved: Imperial Canadian Union, NOPS, Troiya

The Emperor himself made a decree of full mobilization of the state's armed forces in response to the Troiyan threat. In an address today he said "We cannot stay by as our allies are beaten, captured and killed, we must act now or forever feel the shame of not doing so" 

In response to this the entire Armed forces will be deploying directly to the Troiyan homeland or retaking New Yorkian territory from the invader. Canadian Reserves are being mobilized and a mere few hours ago the first set of troops boarded transport planes for Troiya. The navy and airforce also left today, showing off the might of the ICU.
