# GEN: Solborg Calls For New Esteriorean Constitution

Posted by: solborg

Nations involved: Solborg, Esteriore, Other nations participating in sanctions

Solborg and other nations are willing to negotiate the suspension of economic sanctions against Esteriore since the new government takeover if a new constitution is written with safeguards in place to prevent similar events from happening in the future as well as a renunciation of the war crimes that were committed.

Talks are expected soon as Esteriore's new Prime Minister has announced he will be flying to the Solborgian capital of Tammerfors. The Prime Minister of Solborg is grateful that war was avoided, but political opponents on either side have leaped on the opportunity to criticize the way he handled the situation.
