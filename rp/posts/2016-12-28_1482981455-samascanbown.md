# : Continuation Of The Story On The Rebellion 

Posted by: samascanbown

Nations involved: Samascanbown, Samascan

Continuing from our last report, in total there were 17 Insurgents in  a total of 6 Vans.  All of them were eventually killed after heavy fighting that lead to 17 Government Official Deaths. And 2 Civilian Deaths.  The Officer in charge of the garrison stationed in the Capitol building was just glad that our Glorious Leader was making preparations for the upcoming wedding he is to attend.... Oh, um. Mhm. Okay. I just got news that our mother nation that we defected from so many years ago may be assisting the rebels, but it has yet to be confirmed.
