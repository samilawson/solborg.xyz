Posted by: slendergrad

Nations involved: Slendergrad

The perpetrator of last night's break-in at Waynesborg had been found and punished, witnesses said. Said perpetrator was publicly humiliated at the town hall before being decapitated by a local with a machete. Law enforcement officers just stood there and watched the execution. It was even speculated that the executioner was a plain-clothed police officer.

It was also revealed that the perpetrator was the writer of an anti-government blog. So far, several other anti-Slenderians have been caught by vigilantes and locked up in makeshift jails around the country.
