# TERROR: Review of Esterian and Habnan findings

Posted by: gal_may

Nations involved: Gal May, Afghanipajikistan, Habna, Georgekenia, Esteriore, New Nexon

The Commonwealth has begun a review on the data received from the two other cooperating nations. The Ministry of Information will still remain skeptical of the possible leads from Habnan agents as their government is still a suspect in the terror attack. 

Though the findings of The Federated States of Esteriore and The Commonwealth of Habna seem to agree on the terrorist's connection with Georgekenia. 

On the other hand the Habnan agents "conclusion" of the terrorists association with the violetists has been regarded by the Ministry of Information as "...An attempt to halt further investigation." and by a few Esterian agents as "...completely ungrounded...".

The Ministry of Intelligence grows suspicious of Habnan agents but has been advised by the Ministry of Foreign Relations to allow Habnan Agents to continue their investigation.
