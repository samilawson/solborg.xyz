Posted by: the_kolam_brotherhood

Nations involved: The Kolam Brotherhood, Esteriore, Mandalae, Al Ghaza, Adrea, Everybody else who will bid

The Kolam Brotherhood seems to be really interested in that island, so they upped their game. They now offer 10 billion Norrlandic Bitcoins, complete co-belligerent military assistance when at DEFCON 2 or higher, and three bananas plus a beer. The Kolam Brotherhood hopes this offer is considered.
