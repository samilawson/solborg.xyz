Posted by: fascist_adrea

Nations involved: All

After denouncing the Fascists associated with the attack, Adrean diplomats have given an offer to the Mandalae government, concerning the recent attack. Adrean soldiers, some of the best in Europe, can be sent to Mandalae on request to quickly execute any and all operations to be taken against these, or any terrorists. Later today, on popular social media platforms of many different kinds, the Adrean government has stated that it is willing to extend this offer to any and all nations, including that of the Bolsheviks, if so requested.

In a statement made by Iaerme Pales on her personal SocietyAdrea.co.adr account; "Adrea does not wish for any one person to die in any terrorist attack at any point. As such, Adrea will, from this point on, react to any attack whenever possible. If the attack is on foreign soil, then we will await the nation to request our help, if they so wish. It is our duty as a free nation to destroy all threats to World Peace."
