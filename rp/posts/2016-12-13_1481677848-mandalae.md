# TERROR: Nationalists Stage Terror Episode in Mandalae

Posted by: mandalae

Nations involved: Mandalae

Late Monday night, a group of 8 Mandalaean nationalists, who are known to have ties with the far-right Fascist Party, staged a car bombing as well as a capture of 3 immigrants from Al Ghaza.

The terrorists blew up a parked black SUV, and injured 14 pedestrians in the process. Thankfully no one was killed.

However, the terrorists shortly announced on social media that they were the perpetrators of the attack, and are holding 3 immigrants from Al Ghaza hostage at an undisclosed location in the hopes of "returning Mandalae to a nation of the Aryan Race".

The Mandalaean Investigative Bureau, or MIB, is currently searching for the nationalists' location, as the country waits, on-edge.
