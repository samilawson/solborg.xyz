Nations involved: The Kolam Brotherhood, Kievinki, Solborg, The NAL, 

A drone equipped with a bomb exploded in New Aberystwyth today.

The drone flew into a window of the town hall during a meeting. The window shattered and as soon as the drone entered, it detonated, say witnesses. The explosives used were very powerful and destroyed the whole building as it also went up in flames. 7 were killed and 80 were hospitalized. Footage is currently under review, although authorities have already linked the attacks to Calyj Nenba, a Kolami woman of Bornean decent. 

Officials believe the attacks are related to the recent events in Kievinki. Investigators say that this may be a protest to allow more immigrants into the nation, although over 2-hundred thousand are let in every year. A manhunt has been put in place to stop Nenba from committing more crimes.
