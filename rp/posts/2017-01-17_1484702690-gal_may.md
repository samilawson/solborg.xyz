Nations involved: Gal may Troiya

The Prime Minister and The Speaker of the Council of Seven each delivered speeches regarding the Current instability of The Troiyan state and the importance of the pre-emptive defensive measures that were built along the border.

"We, now more than ever, are faced with a threat so great, that our neighbors, even the Great leaders of our earth, tremble in fear. We are no different. We fear what is to come. Our northern neighbor is unstable, we feel threatened by his presence... But we shall not fear any longer. It is our duty to defend the least of these. The enemies of Liberty will not smother this beacon of hope that we call our home. Our Freedom will not be hindered by the acts of a Tyrant!... We will stand with our brothers and sisters at the front lines of Terror and destroy it with the flames of liberty!"
