Posted by: gullandia

Nations involved: Gullandia, Esteriore, Mandalae, North American nations in general

After much deliberation, the citizens of Gullandia have accepted their invitation into the North American League. This is, in part, due to Esteriore's radical shift towards pacifism and diplomacy.

Grand Council Asbj√∏rn Rasmussen commented on the matter saying, "Now that Esteriore is heading down a path of peace and growth, it is beneficial for Gullandia to associate itself with the nation. We hope that our admission into NAL will aid in the improvement of relations with our North American brothers as well as give us protection from potential threats."
