In the response to growing tensions between the native Esnerian population and Bigtopian immigrants,  has announced that the Ministry of Interior will implicate a separate judicial system for the sole purpose of prosecuting Bigtopians living in the Fascist State.

All Bigtopians in Esneria will be subjected to the court in any event to ensure "National security and the survival of Esnerian values."

Furthermore, all businesses and factories owned by Bigtopians will be re-distributed among the Esnerian Native population. Bigtopians have until January 1st to appeal their business in the court.
