# EST: Mandalae Sending More Troops to Esteriore

Posted by: mandalae

Nations involved: Mandalae, Esteriore

In response to the formation of the WSCN alliance, Mandalae will be sending 500 additional troops, adding to a total of 2,500 peacekeeping troops within Esteriore in order to encourage growth and peace under the new government. The government of Mandalae, as well as the rest of the NOPS alliance is deeply troubled at the formation of this seemingly rival group of nations, and will take whatever means necessary to avoid further conflict or loss of life.
