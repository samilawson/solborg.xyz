Upon hearing news of Esteriore's change in ideology, Raikkonia quickly administered a statement in response.

The statement reads:

"We are happy to see a non-aggressive policy from Esteriore. While their strict border policy is somewhat worrisome, it at least comes from a position of concern and peace. We hope that, moving forward, they stay true to their word. If they do, we would be honored to offer them a position as an ally."
