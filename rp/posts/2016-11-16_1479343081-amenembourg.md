# GEN: The red line : Maritime tensions

Posted by: amenembourg

Nations involved: Amenembourg, Skaan

After some clashes in the territorial waters shared between Amenembourg and Skaan because of their geographical proximity, the two countries would have exchanged very hard words through the diplomatic channel.

Fortunately, it appears that the two governments have initiated diplomatic talks in order to warm relations. It would even seem that a solution would be discussed in order to politically manage the dispute between Skaan and Amenembourg

Still, the amenembourgian nationalists have publicly stated that they "do not like a superpower like Amenembourg to negotiate with a small country like Skaan".

Following media criticism of the moderation of the amenembourgian government which preferred the diplomatic channel to the military solution, President John Luke felt obliged to clarify that "the status of Regional Delegate of Norrland detained by Amenembourg required its government to be politically and diplomatically irreproachable in order to ensure peace and prosperity within the region".

The discussions between Skaan and Amenembourg are still ongoing and no one knows whether they will lead to a satisfactory and productive result.
