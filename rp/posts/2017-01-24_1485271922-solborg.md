# VATICAN: PM Comments

Posted by: solborg

Nations involved: Nerisis, Madrilenos, Georgekenia, Solborg

The newly re-elected PM of Solborg, Cooper Johnston of the Secular Democratic Party, recently commented on the situation regarding the Vatican:

"It is unfortunate when religious matters like these can affect our global politics so deeply. The only nation that has a legitimate claim to the Vatican is Nerisis, regardless of what the writings in any holy book say. That being said, I would also like Brody Smitters to refrain from any more comments on the matter as he clearly does not understand the slightest bit about international politics, and he currently only serves to diminish the reputation of actual, knowledgeable members of the nonreligious community."
