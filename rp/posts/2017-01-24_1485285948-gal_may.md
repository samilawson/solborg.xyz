# RELIGION : Support of the Vatican 

Posted by: gal_may

Nations involved: Gal may, Nesiris, Madrilenos

The Largely Catholic Population of The Commonwealth of Gal May have expressed their support for His Holiness the Pope and have petitioned for the Consulate, Speaker, and Prime Minister to take action in order to grant His Holiness the Land that he has been gifted by the Lord. Though reluctant to do so, the mostly Catholic Government has come to the resolution to support the Claims of his Holiness.

"The Vatican has, since time immemorial, belonged to his Holiness, and by extension the Lord our God Himself.The refusal of other nations to recognize the legitimacy of the Pope's Claims is not only somewhat irritating on a religious level but disrespectful to the Catholic faith as a whole." 
This statement, though not official, comes from the Gal Mayian Bureau of Religion and Culture's (GM-B.R.C.) Director, Arch-Bishop Aleksander Taam. Despite the Obvious bias of the Catholic minister, the legislature seems to hold similar ideals.

The Commonwealth of Gal May supports the claims of His Holiness.
