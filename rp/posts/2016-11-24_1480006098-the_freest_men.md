# GEN: The Freest Men sends 300,000 natives into Ibiza

Posted by: the_freest_men

Nations involved: Samsonia2, Stockgrove, Ellenstedt, Odenreig, Kievinki, Gullandia, New Woking, Samsonia3, Portmany Arms Base 

The government of Samsonia2 has deemed it necessary for their colony of The Freest Men to send 300,000 natives to Ibiza to fight Samsonia3. These men will be on the front lines and will keep NOPS soldiers safer, but their training is minimal.
These natives will be ones that have been imprisoned or are actively campaigning against the colonization of their land.
