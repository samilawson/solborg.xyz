Nations involved: New Woking

Prime Minister Paige Bance announced today a complete reform of the political scene for the citizens of New Woking. 
"For too long, our people have been succumbed to an unfair political system, which sees the poor being victimised by the top 5%." She spoke out at a press conference this morning. "I believe that everyone should have an equal say in our nation, and that democracy should be valued greatly." 

Voting for the next election begins in 6 months, and the PM has made it obvious that she wants to remain in power. Following the speech, New Woking was rated on the Diebold election inking scale at the highest point it's ever been. Truly a great time to be a citizen.
