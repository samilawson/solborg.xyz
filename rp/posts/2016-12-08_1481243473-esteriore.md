# GEN: Sanctions posed on Samsonia3

Posted by: esteriore

Nations involved: Esteriore, NOPS, Samsonia3

Following the news that Samsonia3 has defied the treaty proposed by various NOPS nations and founding the Leage of Rogue Nations (LRN), Esteriore has posed a complete and total embargo on trade to Samsonia3, and banning all tourism and flights to the nation. 

This is expected to cripple their economy, and limiting Military development in the nation. All diplomatic ties with the nation are also being severed. We encourage other NOPS nations to pose sanctions on the country.
