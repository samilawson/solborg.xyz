# ALLIANCE: Mandalae and Esteriore Announce Alliance

Posted by: mandalae

Nations involved: Mandalae, Esteriore

The two largest nations in North America, Mandalae and Esteriore, are announcing an alliance.

Although both nations are members of NOPS, Mandalaean and Esterian officials have recognized their common goals and developed the Bilateral American Military Alliance (BAMA). This does not mean that either Mandalae or Esteriore will leave NOPS, rather there will be increased cooperation and intelligence sharing between both countries.

Leaders from Mandalae and Esteriore met in Dellacita, Esteriore's capital, and discussed the strengthened relationship between the two North American powers. Mandalaean President Joseph Hagden said, "I look forward to working with Esteriore in the future to strengthen both our countries positions in the world, as well as to ensure the security of our similar people."
