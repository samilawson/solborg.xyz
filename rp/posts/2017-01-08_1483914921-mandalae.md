# ECO: Mandalae's Economy Weakens with Crash

Posted by: mandalae

Nations involved: Mandalae, Worldwide

Due to the economic crash in Esteriore, the Mandalaean markets have taken a hit. Unemployment has risen to nearly 7%, the highest in over a decade.

Although the effects will not be as devastating and widespread as they are sure to be in Esteriore (due to the plethora of economic regulations Mandalae has), the economy has still been severely hampered by this latest development. Both Mandalae and Esteriore share strong economic ties, and it was inevitable that Mandalae's economy would be adversely effected by the crash. 

Unfortunately, it looks like many countries in North America will feel the effects of Esteriore's market collapsing, especially members of the NAL.
