Nations involved: NOPS, Samsonia3, Solborg, Esteriore, Austrian Habsburgs

Yesterday, the heads of state from Solborg, Esteriore, Samsonia3, and Austrian Habsburgs met to discuss a peaceful solution to the rising tensions between NOPS and the newly creater LRN. A deal has been reached between the nations:

1. All economic sanctions, implemented by NOPS member nations in retaliation for the continuation of nuclear weapons programs by the government of Samsonia3, must be suspended immediately.

2. The government of Samsonia3 must suspend the development of all new weapons of mass destruction and turn over all but two nuclear weapons in its possession to NOPS. Inspectors from NOPS member nations may ensure that Samsonia3 complies.

3. Neither Samsonia3 nor any NOPS member nation may engage in surveillance or espionage upon the other.

4. NOPS member nations may not engage in any proxy wars against the League of Rogue Nations unless a member of the LRN invades a territory unprovoked.

5. All NOPS member nations that currently have ships stationed within 50km of Samsonian waters must withdraw 2/3 of the ships to a distance of at least 200km and remove the remaining 1/3 from the area entirely.

6. Provisions must be enacted within the LRN, which require the compliance of all member nations, to prohibit any unprovoked attacks on NOPS member nations.
