# JRS: Al Ghazan Forces Hold Behind Blockade, Wait for Further Instruction

Posted by: al_ghaza

Nations involved: al ghaza, nops, georgekenia

Al Ghazan forces in Istanbul have been sent to Jerusalem for the purposes of protecting civilians and troops. We will ignore the blockade termporarily to avoid civilian deaths, but aircraft carriers will be sent if Georgekenian forces start to kill soldiers.

Also, Al Ghaza is preoccupied in its current battle to fight with Betiutia and Georgekenia, so it will not be sending reinforcements to Portmany for the time being.
