# TREATY: Samsonia3 Hands Over Nukes as Promised

Posted by: samsonia3

Nations involved: Samsonia3, NOPS 

Speaking of nuclear weapons, Samsonia3 has officially handed over all nuclear weapons but two to the NOPS. The Supreme God-Emperor had this to say about the transfer: "What a deal we have reached. The NOPS is happy while we are still able to defend our autonomy as a nation. We hope this will be the start of normalized relations between... Erm, what? An Esterian nuclear weapon has been stolen and given to... Adrea? Well, we hope that we can start normalizing relations with the NOPS. And Esteriore, what in the world happened? How were your nukes on a highly vulnerable ship? I would've expected more from a highly advanced nation. We will provide support to you though, because we are friends now. Also, this is meant for Adrea, now that you have that nuke, don't give it up so easy. I don't know how you got it but you have leverage now. But if you stole it, well, why would you steal it? You have us, and we have nukes. I don't know, just hang on to that weapon, okay?"

On another note, with the help of our Madagascarean colony, Samsonia3 has finished the manufacturing of 2 of the 3 "PAB-567" Aircraft Carriers, 17 S3-500 Warplanes, 8 S3-999 Submarines, two S3-007 Tanks, and 1 S3-008 Tank. More are being manufactured, but how many more will be made is still under discussion.
