# JRS: Georgekenia Outraged but naught taking action

Posted by: georgekenia

Nations involved: Georgekenia, Al Ghaza

Georgekenia is naught going to verballey accept further insult from Al Ghaza, clarify Brody Smitters.
First Georgekenia claim again that what may seem as inncorrect speech to foreigneurs is actualley simpley our cultural dialect of English we teach in school beacuse it is our English, Georgekenian Enlgish! Al Ghaza is disrespecting our culture. We use it internationalley because it's not like you can naught understand it!
We may disrespects their culture but they are killers!
Second Georgekenia is alreadey a much more intellectuale nation than Al Ghaza by statistic! It is the Al Ghazans who aughts to improves!
Third, we never wanteds to destroy the Al Ghazan people, we wanted them to reform and become much more free and a livable nation! We can naught believes other Norrlandic nations would support an islamice, homophobice, and anti-democratice nation who kill those who do naught fit into their holey view! Sickening! We do naught wishes to fight but we still are naught going to trades with such an evil power and neither should other nations who naught onley value freedom but life itself!
