# FUNERAL: Dalut Cheiftan Dead

Posted by: conaim

Nations involved: Conaim

Bob Hansshes, chief of the Dalut tribe in Conaim, has died at the age of 102 due to...shocker...old age.
He lived along and progressive life for his people to give them the type of status the other Native American tribes had.... The ability to run for office other than chief...protection against discrimination...he helped turn things around for his people.
Why were his people treated badly? Unlike all other parties that joined Conaim in the 19th century, The Daluts were forced to join, they had to because they lost a war to the Ushuts, and the Ushuts did everything in their power to keep the Daluts down, Bob Hansshes was basically to the Daluts what a tin Luther King was to African Americans.
Rest assured he will have a state funeral, all respectful leaders are welcome to attend.
