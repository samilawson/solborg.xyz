Nations involved: Imperial Canadian Union, NOPS

In a press release this morning the Emperor expressed his happiness in saying that discussions had gone well with the general secretary or the Norrland Organisation For Peace. The ICU will now be apart of the exclusive military alliance, and start having to show off it's military muscles.

On another note the PM said today that operations for peace are going well in Slendergrad, and a ceasefire may be coming soon. In an interview today he said "I do hope that they can get along, it's what we've been doing for as long as I can remember" But when a reporter brought up Canada's spotty past with civil strife and rebellion, noting that that was how the ICU first came to power in the first place, PM Bardeaux had no further comment.
