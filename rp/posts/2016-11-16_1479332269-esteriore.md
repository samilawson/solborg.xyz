# GEN: Country in Unstable State

Posted by: esteriore

Nations involved: Esteriore

Several terror attacks have taken place in large Esterian cities in the past days, all of which were motivated by one cause; The Secession of Postore, a large Esterian province. The country is near a state of emergency now.

The province of Postore is the economic engine of Esteriore, and has always been very ideologically different from the rest of the country. For one, they are an island, and they lean more towards the right, contrary to the rest of the country. Massimo Franco was also born in Postore.

A proposal of secession from Esteriore was submitted by the premier of Postore, Lucas Waters (Even though secession violates the constitution). This has been especially motivated by the recent recession in Esteriore, which has lowered the currency's value by a whopping 27,07%. And as you could guess, Postore was hit very hard by this.

Updates will be posted in the coming hours.
