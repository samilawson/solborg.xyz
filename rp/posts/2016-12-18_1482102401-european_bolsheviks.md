Nations involved: European Bolsheviks, Fascist Adrea, Esteriore

As a result of European Bolsheviks' tremendous naval defeat in North America at the Battle of Porto di Fine, the Revolutionary Army has declared that it is sending an additional 400,000 soldiers along with 30 armored vehicles into Northern Adrea.

In the wake of heightened political tensions, the Revolutionary Worker's council has expressed its concern about European Bolsheviks' ability to defend the People's Republic from further advancement by the enemy. 

The Revolutionary Army has been pushed back to the small town of Baja in Adrea's North-Eastern Region. 

Generals are awaiting further instructions from the European Bolshevik Party HQ in Lublin whilst their troops are reinforced. 

As of right now, fighting has somewhat seized, with only a few firefights reported in the region.
