# WAR: Samsonian Forces Betray Archer Lee in Slendergrad!

Posted by: samsonia3

Nations involved: Slendergrad, Samsonia3

In a shocking turn of events, Archer Lee was flayed living after being betrayed by Samsonia3's soldiers! The new leadership of Slendergrad had a better deal to offer to Samsonia3, so the army captured Lee and killed most of his men in the middle of the night! Slendergrad's new leadership promised support in the form of cattle, wheat, and other agricultural products as well as an open Base of Operations where Waynesborg once stood.
