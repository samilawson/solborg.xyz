Posted by: gal_may

Nations involved: Kievinki, Habna, Georgekenia, Gal May, Afghanipakijikista

The Commonwealth of Gal May has issued an official embargo on the nations of  Habna, and Georgekenia. Any previous diplomatic ties and endorsements are to be nullified. 

The Commonwealth will be excepting at least fifty thousand refugees from Afghanipakijikista and will be thoroughly working to ensure a smooth integration into her democracy.

This formal Denouncement of The Democratic Republic of
Georgekenia and The Commonwealth of Habna, establishes the nullification of the "Neutral Foreign Relations Act" and will now allow The Commonwealth of Gal May to carry out "controversial" foreign aid missions, as well as permit defensive trans-national defensive military action.

This action also imposes minor sanctions onThe White Holy Kingdom of Kievinki, temporarily prohibiting the entry of Kievinkian citizens into The Commonwealth of Gal May. This sanction will not annul the Commonwealths endorsement of the Kievinkian government and will be revoked once either:

a: The Kievinkian Government retracts all derogatory statements made of Muslims

b: A time limit has been met

c: The Kievinkian Government officially sanctions both The Democratic Republic of Georgekenia and The Commonwealth of Habna.
