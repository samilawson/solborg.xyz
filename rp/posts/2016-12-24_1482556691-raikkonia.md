# EMERGENCY: Raikkonian President Receives Alarming Message

Posted by: raikkonia

Nations involved: Raikkonia, Solborg

A medical scare plagued Scandinavia today.

Raikkonian leader Henri Saarinen-Korpela feared that Cooper Johnston of Solborg was having a stroke after receiving a telegram. The contents of the telegram said, "hi pls join dis NOPs thx," an uncharacteristically sloppy and poorly enuciated message.

The leader was found to be fine and had left the message for a young intern to write.
