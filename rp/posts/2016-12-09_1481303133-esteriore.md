# NOPS: Esteriore gives room to breathe

Posted by: esteriore

Nations involved: NOPS Nations, Samsonia3, Esteriore

As the meeting between Samsonia3 and Solborg nears, Esteriore has chosen to distance the Navy from Samsonia3's coasts and the Army from their borders, as to avoid incidents during the meeting. As a small misstep could lead to war. 

The Demiliterized border between the countries however, will still have some troops patrolling. Esterian Prime Minister Carver Marion would be glad to attend the meeting (if that is indeed possible). He would like to speak with the God Emperor about civil rights, political rights and nuclear weapons. He hopes that Esteriore and Samsonia3 can reach a formal deal, that will benifit both Samsonia3 and the international community.
