# CIVIL WAR: Mandalae Accepts Kolam into the NAL Again; Still Attempting to Oust Rebels

Posted by: mandalae

Nations involved: Mandalae, the Kolam Brotherhood, NAL

Even as Mandalae was shocked to find that the Kolam Brotherhood had sided with the fascist rebels, the country has accepted the Kolam Brotherhood back into the NAL (despite their violation of the treaty). The new PM of the Kolami telegrammed president Hagden to assure him that most of his country's people thought the invasion was brash, ill-conceived, and stupid, and that the newly elected government would try to mend ties with Mandalae. 

In other news, the remaining rebels are all but surrounded in a small pocket centered around the city of Zorfum, New Harrison. Mandalaean troops are advancing and attempting to drive the rebels from the important urban center. 

The entire country is expected to once more be under Mandalaean control in a matter of hours.
