Nations involved: All

In the wake of the WOV attacks, higher-up stadtholders in Adrea have recently attempted to distract the populace from panic, lest a riot begin. In this attempt, they have pointed out how the Christmas celebration to be held Conaim, Ellen, may so anger the WOV, and how Adreans needn't worry about any attacks on Adrean soil, as per the nation's lack of religious sentiments should dissuade any attacks, conveniently forgetting that Adrea's religious policies are still an insult towards the WOV, almost explicitly. Considering that the party is to be held for leaders only, the stadtholders have begged Iaerme Pales to stay in Adrea, but she has refused to comment as of yet.
