Nations involved: Esteriore

The polls have just been closed, and Esteriore has a new leader. Federal party leader Michela Caravello has won the election by a 5% lead. Her rival, Giovanni Vatalaro, has just conceded, but criticised the fact that the election was fast-tracked.

Results were 45.9% For the Federal party, 40.1% for the Socialists, 2.8% for the Fascists and 1.2% for the Communists. This came as a surprise to many, especially the fact that the Fascists had a margain of 2.8% this year, compared to the average .6%. Fascist support will be monitored closely over the next cycle.
