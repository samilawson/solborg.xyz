Posted by: vladstok

Nations involved: Vladstok

The Vladstokian Parliament has determined that "regional instability potentially leading to humanitarian crises" will lead to the establishment and expansion of several refugee camps inside the nation. These camps are open to anyone fleeing political conflict and will accept anyone who can make it to Vladstok's borders. The camps will be able to hold 200,000 individuals, with the ability to expand them to hold a total of 750,000 individuals.

Prime Minister Olgya Estern said in a speech Friday: "Vladstok will do everything she possibly can to assist the peoples of Norrland in the times ahead, while maintaining neutrality and peace within our borders. We will gladly accept as many refugees and immigrants as possible, and I sincerely hope that peace will reign over the region for many years to come."
