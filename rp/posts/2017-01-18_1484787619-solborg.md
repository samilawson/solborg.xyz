# WAR: Solborg Strikes Petrozavodsk

Posted by: solborg

Nations involved: Solborg, Troiya, Kievinki

The Solborgian NFV (air force) launched an air strike on the Troiyan city of Petrozavodsk at 02:58 shortly after NOPS approved the use of offensive strikes against the country. A total of 15 fighter planes were used in a coordinated effort to strike runways and military bases in the city. All targets were successfully hit, although one plane was shot down. The pilot ejected from the plane before it was hit, and he is currently presumed alive. A rescue mission is being planned with Kievinki.
