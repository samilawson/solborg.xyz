# GEN: Symbol declares support for the WSCN

Posted by: nerisis

Nations involved: Nerisis, Hiachijan, et cetera

The Symbol of Nerisis has declared her support for the newly formed WSCN tonight. She has also decided to withdraw the last few troops from the former territory of Gobwin Knob and let it fade into the history of the country of Ellenstedt who had now annexed the territory. Let them always remember the sacrifice made by our operatives to defeat Stanley Garson.
