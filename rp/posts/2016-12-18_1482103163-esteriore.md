Posted by: esteriore

Nations involved: Esteriore, European Bolsheviks, Fascist Adrea, Samsonia3

Esteriore has begun preperations for the battle of Baja against the European Bolshevik's Revolutionary Army.

All 10,000 Aircraft currently in Europe have landed in Adrea for refuelling and repairs while more troops from Esteriore arrive in the coming hours. To this point, 287,000 Troops are currently in Adrea waiting for commands, and 10,000 are making their way there right now.

Reconnaissance Aircraft are currently scouting the future battlefield to map out the enemy's location, but they are very well hidden in the woods, so the Bolsheviks get the element of surprise this time.

The Esterian army will attempt a knockout blow here to pave a way for a full invasion of Bolshevik territory. This battle will be pivotal to the current war.
