# NUCLEAR: Adrea Sends More Inspectors

Posted by: fascist_adrea

Nations involved: Adrea, Bolsheviks

In accordance with the treaty signed many weeks ago between the LRN and the EB, Adrean Inspectors have been scowering evert nook and crannie of the Bolsheviks territory, hunting for any and all nuclear capabilities. Due to a slow start, and the inability to effectively cover the entire nation with thorough searches with the current numbers, Adrea is now sending another hundred inspectors across the Budapest Danube bridge, each with their own military escort.
