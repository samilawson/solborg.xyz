# ECONOMOY: The People's Republic has the Best Economy in the World!

Posted by: european_bolsheviks

Nations involved: European Bolsheviks

In response to the growing instabilities with the global economy, the Minister of Finance has humorously embarrassed the West by revealing that the European Bolshevik hasn't been affected by the crash, and that the country will undoubtedly withstand any financial trials in the future. 

In an interview with Revolutionary State News channel 1, the Immortal Dear Leader stated that "the lasting prosperity of the People's Republic is a testimony to the efforts of creating a proletarian worker's utopia within the borders of European Bolsheviks."

Additionally, the Immortal Dear Leader warned that "this incident is merely a reminder that the failure of the capitalist system is inevitable, and that the subsequent revolution of the proletariat will liberate the western workers from their oppressive regimes."

The Immortal Dear Leader gave the interview after several claims arose that the construction of Nuclear Power plants has been halted due to 'security concerns.' However, these deceptive claims have already been refuted by the European Bolshevik Party's Commission for Energy Safety, and the glorious plans are scheduled to resume on January 15. 

GLORY TO THE IMMORTAL DEAR LEADER!
