The Vladstok Extraterrestrial Aeronautics Agency has officially announced that it will be launching a satellite in a little less than one month's time. Prime Minister Olgya Estern had a press interview Saturday afternoon about this launch.

"We are proud to announce the launch of the Blustock I, which will be a low-orbit weather satellite fixed over Vladstok. It will be launched on February 14th, and we are all anxiously awaiting it's departure from the Nukovilk Space Center. If the launch succeeds, it will be a grand start to what we hope will be a tradition of scientific advancement and prosperity for our nation and the VEAA."

The launch of a satellite on Valentine's Day is sure to stir the hearts of romantics and scientists alike.
