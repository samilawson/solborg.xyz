# ALLIANCES: New Woking NOPS Referendum

Posted by: new_woking

Nations involved: New Woking, NOPS

Today the Government has authorised a referendum for the continuation of New Woking's alliance with NOPS. In recent times, tensions across the globe have increased significantly, with the likes of Esteriore and Samsonia3 having incredible hostilities.

The people of New Woking have the choice to leave the NOPS union, as the terms seem to be not what was expected when New Woking joined. The Prime Minister spoke out today: "New Woking joined NOPS for economic and defense purposes, however the economic benefits have been minimal and our defense has only improved internally. Today is a big choice for the citizens of New Woking to decide whether they'd prefer to be involved in wars, or peace."

Voting closes at 7pm GMT, with results likely to be announced at 10pm GMT.
