# AFGHANIPAJIKISTAN : Habna can't hold any immigrants!

Posted by: habna

Nations involved: Mandalae, Habna, Afghanipajikistan 

Natata Worshnev is outraged at Mandalae for cutting ties with them due to Habna not excepting refugees.

"Even if we wanted them here, we would have no where for them to stay, if you have a good memory you would recall that just two months ago this country was ravaged in its own civil war that destroyed much of our infrastructure. You can't but water into a container full of holes, people left our country not the other way around"
