# WAR: Samsonia3 Lands on Georgekenian Soil!

Posted by: samsonia3

Nations involved: Samsonia3, Georgekenia

Samsonia3 has officially landed on Georgekenian soil! The army's march, which includes a huge but still-not-disclosed number of soldiers, has come to an end at Marsa Matruh, where the Aircraft Carriers have docked. The Tanks and Planes are being deployed right now, and the troops seem to be planning to go for Georgekenia's throat in Cairo, though it is not certain if these reports are true or fake. 

These Samsonia3 soldiers have been seen with soldiers of an unknown nation, and this unknown ally has also apparently given them warplanes. The unknown nation seems to make up nearly half of the ground forces. This invasion, especially with the unknown nation's backing, seems like it will be over quickly.
