# NOPS: Comments on Georgekenian Nukes

Posted by: solborg

Nations involved: NOPS, Georgekenia

The NOPS Secretary General, Jans Ã…kesson, commented on Georgekenia's announcement of their nuclear program. He called these plans "potentially dangerous, given the hostile actions [Georgekenia] has previously taken against one of our members," this referring to the naval blockade of Al Ghaza that the country established during the Jerusalem conflict.

It is currently unknown whether any measures will officially be taken against Georgekenia or what those measures would consist of.
