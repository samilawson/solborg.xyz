Samsonia3 has made an important ultimatum towards NOPS troops.

"We are tired of the fighting. We obviously have the leverage here. But I am not in the business of senseless killing. So I propose a deal.
In exchange for a complete withdrawal of all troops from our territory, admittance into trade unions and the like, and a colony on Madagascar since we aren't getting Morocco, we will give up all of our nuclear weapons gifted to us by Gothsong except for two. These two weapons will be jointly managed by Samsonia3 and the alliance they are in, meaning we cannot fire them on our own. We only want them for self defense. 
If this deal is agreed to, we will stop all hostilities towards Samsonia2 and meet with their leader in a neutral location to discuss the end to hostilites.

We want to get on to bigger and better things, like exploring space, and if we are allowed back into the international community, we have a fantastic idea for exploration. We hope you agree to this treuce.

BUT, if you do not agree to this generous treaty, we will not hesitate to use nuclear weapons on any and all nations that enter our territory."
