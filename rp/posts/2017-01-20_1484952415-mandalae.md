# WAR: Mandalaean Special Forces Execute Head Troiyan in Borneo

Posted by: mandalae

Nations involved: Mandalae, New Nexon, Troiya

At 3:00 AM in the Borneo city of Sintang, a small group of 15 Mandalaean special forces troops entered a compound where the leader of Troiyan operations in Borneo was thought to be held.

Roughly 15 minutes later, the team was waiting for aerial extraction via helicopter after having executed the Troiyan General and a few of his advisers.

This comes at a time when Troiyan forces across the island are in a full-scale retreat, falling back to the more remote and highly forested areas of the island.

The outcome of this execution is unclear, but it appears as if Troiyan forces are in relative disarray. 

New Nexonan and Mandalaean forces are still advancing and will not stop until Troiya surrenders.
