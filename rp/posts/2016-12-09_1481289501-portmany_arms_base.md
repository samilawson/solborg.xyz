# ALLIANCES: Samsonia3's Abandoned Colony Opts to join LRN, Begins Producing Weapons for Samsonia3

Posted by: portmany_arms_base

Nations involved: Samsonia3, Portmany Arms Base

Portmany Arms Base has made the decision to join the League of Rogue Nations. Thanks to its large spending on arms manufacturing, they are able to provide ample help to Samsonia3 in the form of planes, anti-aircraft measures, and ships. Their main project, along with producing the Samsonia3-designed machines (see earlier post), will be to produce 3 "PAB-567 Aircraft Carriers". These carriers will be heavily armored and equipped with advanced anti-aircraft and anti-projectile technology. Completion not expected for some time, though.
