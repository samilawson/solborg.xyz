Recently, Muhammad Abdullah Al-Safar released a statement on television in Kandahar Province, claiming responsibility for the assassination of the Nexonian Pope during his visit to Georgekenia. 

"Once NOPS and their puppets realize that their inferior ideology will perish, the Violetist empire will reign over the world and liberate the souls of billions! Many have died, and many will die in the name of this goal!", said the terrorist leader, as bombs illuminated the night sky behind him, muffling the sound beyond comprehension. 

For the past month, the cities of Kandahar and Zahedan in southern Afghanipakijikistan have been under siege by DFA and NAAV  coalition forces, forcing nearly 20,000 civilians to flee towards the border with Al-Ghaza. 

At the same time, the Nationalist League of Arabs based in Islamabad has begun attacking the city of Ludhiana inside Cacusian Colonial territory. NLA Leader Ahmed Nasser justified the militia's stance by declaring that "the west doesn't have the right to simply establish colonies at whim and exploit the east."

So far, these NLA attacks have only consisted of isolated rockets being fired into the aforementioned city, along with other smaller municipalities, however Ahmed Nasser warns of an impending invasion using ground troops.
