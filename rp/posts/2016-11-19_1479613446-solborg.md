# GEN: NOPS Sends Troops To Samsonia2

Posted by: solborg

Nations involved: NOPS, Samsonia2, Samsonia3

In reaction to the threats from Samsonia3, the Secretary General of NOPS, Jans Åkesson, has ordered the emergency deployment of 6500 troops to Samsonia2 and their Moroccan territory as well as 1000 additional troops to southern Odenreig. Most of the troops are from Ellenstedt, Mandalae, and Vladimirstan. Åkesson also commented that NOPS will not hesitate to defend any of their members from foreign aggression. It would be unwise for Samsonia3 to escalate the situation any further.
