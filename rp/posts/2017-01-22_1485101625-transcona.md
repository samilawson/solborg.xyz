# WAR: Reconstruction

Posted by: transcona

Nations involved: Transcona

Following the recent surrender by Troiya, the Transconan government revealed its plans to reconstruct the country, and turn it into a vibrant, peaceful and respectable nation.

The plan involves sending construction teams to rebuild bombed cities, fund businesses to rebuild the economy, provide food & water rations to starving citizens and build several transport systems across the nation to ease travel and move goods.

All that is needed is a greenlight from the new Troiyan government for the project to begin. If the program is approved, other nations are welcome to aid in reconstruction. Our target is to mold Troiya into a vibrant and peaceful nation, after all.
