# WAR: Hiachijan Remains Alert

Posted by: hiachijan

Nations involved: Hiachijan, Samascanbown, Troiya, New Yorkia, Ialicus, Cacusia

In the events of this unexpected war between nations, Hiachijan has declared neutrality, unless it, or its protectorate Samascanbown, is invaded.

Currently, the military is mobilizing, and will remain on high alert until this nonsense is over with. We will also be calling for embargoes on any existing trade routes with Troiya and Ialicus, as we view their actions as highly uncalled for and unnecessary.

Additionally, we have received word of the admirable speech made in Cacusia. However, there is a famous quote that originates from Hiachijan, coming from an old Hiachijanese philosopher:

"War is something that almost nobody enjoys. However, at the same time, no one can help but accept that it is one of the easiest-to-understand languages in the world."
