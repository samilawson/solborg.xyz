Posted by: slendergrad

Nations involved: Slendergrad, Samsonia3

A Slendergradian government spokesman corrected the statement made by Samsonia3's government, saying that it was the rebel leader Evan Lee who was flayed, not the new President Archer Lee. The new government apologised for the miscommunication.

With the uprising(s) quelled, the new government sets about restructuring the country and repairing damaged. A constitution is currently in the process of being drafted.
