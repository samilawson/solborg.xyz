# NEWS: Samsonia3 Returns and Catches Everyone up on Domestic Events

Posted by: samsonia3

Nations involved: Samsonia3

After Samsonia3's soldiers found Esteriore's nuclear weapon, our nation went silent for a good amount of time. Nothing major happened in that time, but here are the main things that happened, are happening, and will happen.

First off, Samsonia HAS claimed the territories of Newfoundland, Algeria, and Madagascar. This land should be marked on the map soon, and people will be moved there, as well as natives becoming naturalized. Right now, the moving and naturalization process is occurring, and Samsonia3 is looking to Asia and South America to attempt to have a stronghold in all parts of the globe.

Secondly, Samsonia3 has recovered Esteriore's nuke and added it to their own arsenal. They have 3 nuclear weapons now. Samsonia3 is NOT developing nuclear weapons, though.

Finally, Samsonia3 is officially Disbanding the LRN. Instead, they will forge individual alliances with each nation present in the League. Samsonia3 was never truly invested into the League, and individual alliances will be forged instead.
