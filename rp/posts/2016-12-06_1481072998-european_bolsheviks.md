Nations involved: European Bolsheviks

Yesterday, a research team from the institute for Great European Bolshevik Discoveries came across a cave in the Peoples Republic's mountainous region with a sign titled "Unicorn Lair" at the entrance. 

Upon entry, the scientists found what they describe to be "compelling evidence for the existence of living unicorns."

Minister of Interior, Pyotr Arashenko, stated that based on the report about the discovery, the unicorns most likely live in a "socialist animal society". 

The Revolutionary Worker's council has announced that under no circumstances are foreign researchers permitted to enter the country to locate and study the elusive socialist unicorn, since there is a possibility that they could "disrupt the communist harmony of these creatures by exposing them to capitalist rhetoric." 

Glory to the Council and to our Scientists!
