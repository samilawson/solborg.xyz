# WAR: Surprise attack at Porto di Fine

Posted by: esteriore

Nations involved: Esteriore, European Bolsheviks

The recently re-routed submarines from the European Bolsheviks have just attacked the coastal city of Porto di Fine.

They began firing on the city at approximately 1:23 PM near the central most port. After emerging from the sea, a crew of over 50 people combined came out of the submarines and began massacring civilians nearby. 1 building collapsed, and the death toll from the attack is 598 People at this point.

Luckily, the coastal guard arrived in time before the submarines were able to submerge. The submarines were captured, along with 150 more crew, and all the attackers were killed by the national guard who arrived an hour later.

In response to this, the commander of the Esterian 1st Army is preparing for a full land invasion of European Bolsheviks. The land taken will be split in half between Adrea and Esteriore, along with all the cities and resources with the land. 

200,000 soldiers, 167 tanks and 1389 AFVs are currently being sent by the army. Most of which will land from supply airplanes in the coming hours.
