# MORMONS: Radical Mormons Steal Christmas!

Posted by: conaim

Nations involved: Conaim, Vladimirstan

The much awaited international Christmas party has been canceled as a result of an devastating attack on the City of Ellen killing 93 people.
The radical group has been identified as a radical Mormon independence group named the Sons of Utah or SU for short.

This attack is said to have been triggered by the more secular, liberal government and civil rights which the Mormon community is not fond of.

The radical groups ultimate goal is to create a Mormon state spanning all of Utah, taking land from Conaim and Vladimirstan!
Once formed Christians, Jews, Muslims, Atheists, Homosexuals, and otherwise non-Mormons will be given the choice to leave Utah or die.

Conaim is willing to fight against this movement.
