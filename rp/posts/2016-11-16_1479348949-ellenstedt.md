Posted by: ellenstedt

Nations involved: Ellenstedt, Solborg, Stockgrove, Firge, Nerisis, Magma Bananas, Esteriore

Five countries (Ellenstedt, Solborg, Stockgrove, Firge, and Magma Bananas) have begun a joint peacekeeping mission in Esteriore, sending a total of 6000 troops as of this evening. Nerisis may also be contributing in the future. The goals are to assist the new government in its transition, control secessionist movements, establish order, and ensure the smooth implementation of a new, war-renouncing constitution as well as the trial of former government members before an international tribunal.

The president of Ellenstedt stated that "it is important to make sure [Esteriore] is steered in the right path during this time of instability." No date for withdrawal has currently been set, although government members have repeated that the missions will only be temporary.
