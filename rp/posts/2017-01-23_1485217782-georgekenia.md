The president of Georgekenia, Brody Smitter, annaunced his opinion of the Vatican debate.
"Honestley the idea of an independent Vatican...is completley retarded...why? Why naught? Think abaut it- a building, being and independent contrey, smallest on earth, but naught onley that but also being inside another countrey inside another contrey. In other news the independent Jerusalem was also verer dim. We need to put to these autmoded sites of ancient hatred behind us and focus on a more intellegent futour."

In other words he has denounced this idea, and once again showed his disaprovale of religion.
