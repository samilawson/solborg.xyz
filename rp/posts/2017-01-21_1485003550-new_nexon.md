Posted by: new_nexon

Nations involved: New Nexon, Amenembourg

His Imperial Majesty Emperor Slender has announced that Nexon will be building an underwater tunnel which would connect a railway with neighbouring Amenembourg.

The railway will start from Hong Kong, which would then pass through several stops. These stops are Guangzhou, Xiamen, Fuzhou, Hangzhou, Nexon City, Shanghai (where the Nexonan end of the underwater tunnel will be located) and Jeju, which would be an interchange station. The railway would then be divided into a Korean Peninsular Railway and an Amenembourgian Homeland Railway. The KPR would take passengers to Gwangju, Incheon and Seoul. The AHR would take passengers to Nagasaki, Hiroshima, Osaka, Nagoya, Fraiburg (Tokyo) and Sapporo. 

The trains running on them will be advanced Hyperloop trains, which will travel at speeds up to 800 miles per hour.
