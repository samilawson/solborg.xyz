# TRANSPORT: Nexon to Build Vacuum Train Railway

Posted by: new_nexon

Nations involved: Nexon

In an effort to reduce travelling speed within the Empire, Nexon has announced that it will be building an experimental VacTrain system in the mainland. The railway will initially run from Shanghai to Nexon City, and then later on expanded to Hangzhou and Nanjing. The VacTrains will travel at a speed of up to 1,200 km/h, allowing people from Shanghai to reach the imperial capital in tens of minutes. If the experiment proves to be successful, VacTrains will be replacing hyperloop trains as the primary form of inter-city rail transportation.
