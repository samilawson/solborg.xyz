# CAUCASIA: President of Mandalae Criticizes Caucasia in Scathing Statement

Nations involved: Mandalae, Caucasia

President Hagden, in his most recent press conference, went on something of a rant when asked a question about Caucasia's actions in response to international sanctions.

"All the international community desired was for the Caucasian government to not INTENTIONALLY KILL CIVILIANS by launching missiles into innocent countries. That was the purpose of all of our sanctions. But the Caucasian government, in its infinite stupidity, took direct offense at our criticism and completely overreacted. Their theatrical, and frankly irresponsible publicity stunt of completely shutting down the government over some sanctions makes them look all the more inept. All I want, and I'm sure what all the other members of the international community wants, is for innocent people to not be harmed. That's it. Pretty simple. But instead of trying to actually SOLVE this issue and take the criticism and sanctions as a lesson, the Caucasian government decided to proclaim to the world its utter incompetence. That'll be all, thank you."
