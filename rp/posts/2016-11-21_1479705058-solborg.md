Posted by: solborg

Nations involved: Solborg, EEO, NOPS

Solborg is entering the space race with Skolborg on a mission to the moon. Solborgian Astronaut Anders Thuresson will be flying in the space shuttle. A number of experiments will also be sent up to be conducted, three of which will be from secondary schools who win a contest to create the best experiment. The Prime Minister also commented regarding Habna's moon conquering accusations, "I said we were conquering the moon? I don't remember saying that. I don't think anybody said that. It's quite funny, to be honest."

In other news, Solborg has joined the European Economic Organization or EEO. The government hopes to negotiate a trade agreement with North American nations sometime in the near future.

The Secretary General of NOPS has commented on the disintegration of WSCN, saying, "While it may seem fortunate that [WSCN] has been dissolved, it is also important to acknowledge the role Esteriore played in holding back some member nations from going completely off the deep end. Now they no longer have such restraints."
