# ALLIES: Sanctions Against Samsonia3

Posted by: solborg

Nations involved: Solborg, Firge, Ellenstedt, Stockgrove, New Telemark, Samsonia3, Esteriore

The NOPS Secretary General, Jan's Ã…kesson, condemned the government of Samsonia3 for violating the agreement that had been negotiated just last week. He called the recent developments "a substantial threat to world peace." The NOPS threat level has been raised back to seven, once again declaring a state of emergency. 12,000 troops are being sent to Samsonia2 and Odenreig for defense.

Solborg, Stockgrove, Firge, Ellenstedt, and New Telemark have agreed to imposing a ban on all transactions with the Samsonian government and the businesses it works with. These nations, except for Firge, have also issued travel warnings for Samsonia3 and encourage all citizens to return.

New Telemark and Ellenstedt will also be deploying their navies across the northern Atlantic to search for the stolen Esteriorean ship. They will use spy planes and radar.
