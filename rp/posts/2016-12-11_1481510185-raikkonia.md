# RP EVENT: Raikkonia begrudingly responds to Esteriore

Posted by: raikkonia

Nations involved: Esteriore

Henri Saarinen-Korpela, leader of Raikkonia, has released a public statement in response to the election crisis in Esteriore. He was quoted as saying the following:

"It may not be our affair, but at the discretion of Sir Marion, I believe it would be best for their interests to allow the Socialist Party to take control so as to allow continuation of their social and political freedoms. My only concern is of their potential ideological extremism, but I feel as though they have better guidance for Esteriore."

Korpela's response was notably rushed, meeting with mixed reviews as far as its contents. Critics also pointed out his uncertainty, although some have argued that this is more due to the abrupt nature of the election.
