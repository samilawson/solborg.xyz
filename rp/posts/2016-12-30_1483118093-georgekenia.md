The president of Georgkenia has stated that honestly such an attack seems random and stupid and would have no benefit for Gerogekenia "I mean really" he says " Even if this guy happened to be from our country he would only be hurting our fragile relationships and not much else, some patriot he is" Brody Smitters than gives the middle finger, symbolically towards the attack.
