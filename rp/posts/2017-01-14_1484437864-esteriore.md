# GEN: Recent Events

Posted by: esteriore

Nations involved: Esteriore, Troiya

Today, an executive order meant to reshape the Esterian economy, was put into place. It is meant to modify the restrictions on Esterian businesses to avoid another financial crash of this scope in the future. The employment rate is expected to increase soon, and the economic crash to be declared over. Or, in Esteriore at least. The world economy is still in bad shape, and we encourage other nations to follow suite to revitalize their economies.

Concerning foreign relations, sanctions on Troiya have officially been put into place after the recent uprising in Borneo. Vladimir I stated that military action will be taken against this peaceful nation, which motivated Michela Caravello to place the sanctions. She asks for Vladimir I to give up on his territorial agression, lest he wants Troiya's economy to be crippled. For the time being, aid in the form of money and supplies will be sent to Borneans, who are undoubtedly in shock after the recent events.
