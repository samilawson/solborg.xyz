Posted by: fascist_adrea

Nations involved: Fascist Adrea, Esteroire, Nerisis, Kataria

Hearing the news of the nuclear deal happening along Adrean borders, Iaerme has decided that if the Esteroirian aircraft carrier is sighted, it will be fired upon by Adrean land, air, and sea weapons. Though they will attempt to pacify it, as it is an expensive peice of equipment owned by Esteroire, Iaerme has made no promises. A large portion of the northern garrison has gone across the north west, scouring the Slovenian region for any sign of the terrorists, search parties covering any possible region.

Souxand Trevix has come out with another statement in the wake of the event, denouncing nuclear weapons and all nations that hold them, with the obvious exception of Samsonia3. He has long been against the use of the devices, however is now more aggressive in his policies with recent events.
