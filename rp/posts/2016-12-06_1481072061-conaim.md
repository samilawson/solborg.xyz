# WOV: Conaim apologizes to Sheikh Ameen for unintended offense

Posted by: conaim

Nations involved: Conaim

The government of Conaim has issued an apology to Ameen of Afghanipakijistan, after offending him by ordering the execution of Violetist terrorist Jim Jitterson.

However the execution will still go as planned as a bomb was not and never will be just to use upon a peaceful nation's public.

Furthermore Conaimese officials find the new policy toward shyest people on Afghanipakistani soil ridiculous although the nation will not force them to change it.
It should also be noted that the terrorist in question was born and raised in Conaim, and has no blood from any tradionally violetist nations.
He is in death row because that is the penalty for terrorism.
