# UPRISING: Uprising in Troiyan Borneo

Posted by: troiya

Nations involved: Troiya, Borneo

On the 14th of January 2017, a revolt in Borneo caused a long series of uprisings. Eventually the Troiyan forces in Borneo had to retreat after the rebels had been given funding from the Socialist Rebellion in Troiya. Borneo has officially become independent and is now the "People's Republic of Borneo".

Monarch of Troiya, Vladimir I, states that military action shall be taken in the next few weeks.
