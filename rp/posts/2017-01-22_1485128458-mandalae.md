# ECO: Mandalae and Kanisland Expand Relationship

Posted by: mandalae

Nations involved: Mandalae, Kanisland

Fellow NAL members Mandalae and Kanisland have announced a new economic agreement between the two countries, as well as further military cooperation.

Both nations have agreed to increase trade and economic cooperation, seeing as it would work for their mutual benefit.

In addition, Kanisland has agreed to let the Mandalaean government construct a military base on the eastern coast of the country's territory, primarily for defense purposes (of the NAL). The base will house around 1,000 personnel, and joint military exercises between the two nations will occur regularly.
