# WAR: Mandalae Declares War on Troiya

Posted by: mandalae

Nations involved: Mandalae, Esteriore, Troiya, New Yorkia, the Imperial Canadian Union, others

New Yorkia has just been inducted into the North American League because of its Canadian holdings. As a result, Mandalae has officially declared war on Troiya, the perpetrator of this meaningless conflict, in its commitment to defend any and all NAL nations who are attacked.

The Mandalaean Navy (MN) is currently traveling to the Troiyan coast in order to blockade the nation, while the Mandalaean Air Force (MAF) and army (MA) are joining with other NAL member nations to liberate New Yorkia.

Once New Yorkia is liberated, Mandalae will move the bulk of its forces to combat Troiya in their own territory.

President Hagden also encouraged other NAL members to join with New Yorkia in their fight against the oppression of the Troiyans.
