# ALLIES: New Woking's military support

Posted by: new_woking

Nations involved: Samsonia3, NOPS

Early this morning, it was announced that NOPS nations were to launch a militaristic attack towards Samonia3's base in Portmany. Many allies have already landed in the area, and New Woking will be following shortly.

"During the early hours of the morning, our brave troops marched on through unmarked territories to supply our allies with the help they need." The defense minister speaks out. "We sent the our military towards Boston, where we were able to deploy our troops overseas."

Due to a geographical disadvantage, New Woking hasn't been able to send as many troops as desired, as they don't have a port accessible to the ocean, and their planes can't carry more than 40 soldiers at a time.
