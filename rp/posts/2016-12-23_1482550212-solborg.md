Posted by: solborg

Nations involved: Esteriore, Hispatia, Stoichia, Ellenstedt, Stockgrove

Intelligence services in a joint mission from Ellenstedt and Stockgrove have intercepted a number communications from the government of Esteriore. Plans have been uncovered to possibly invade New Woking for their rejection of the Trans-American Oil Pipeline as well as to block off the Panama Canal, a territory of Hispatia, with military force.

The NOPS Secretary General Jans Ã…kesson was notified of the communications, and he has since collaborated with the government of Stoichia to organize a naval defense of Hispatia in the area surrounding the Panama Canal. An offer for New Woking to re-join NOPS is also being extended.
