# NOPS: Joint NOPS Territory Established

Posted by: solborg

Nations involved: New Telemark, NOPS

The government of New Telemark, with approval from the NOPS Secretary General, has recently annexed the territory of Prince Edward Island. The island, which is located between New Telemark and New Woking, has been devoid of a government since the fall of Isle of Woman. The local people have been living in chaos since the government's fall, with high crime and multiple militias taking power. New Telemark will establish a local government to protect the civilians and combat crime.

The island will also be used as a military base for NOPS operations. Currently, a number of Telemarkian military assets have been stationed there.
