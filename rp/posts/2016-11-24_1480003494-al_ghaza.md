Nations involved: Al Ghaza, Gothsong

A local protest by the capitol building in Istanbul broke out on the morning of November 24th. Protesting against the recent trade embargo against Gothsong, they were met with over forty law enforcement officers for crowd control. The protest started nonviolent and civilized, but some protesters started destroying property surrounding the building. Law enforcement got involved and many protesters started to resist, resulting in 13 injured protesters and 2 injured officers. This is just one of the few riots that have been occurring throughout the country recently. These riots mark the anger towards the government that Al Ghazans are feeling after the recent foreign policy approach the government is taking.
