# GEN: Hiachijan's Plans to Conquer Venus

Posted by: hiachijan

Nations involved: Hiachijan, Amaldrus, Habna

Emperor Yhumeni and Empress Aulmerri have displayed their interest in international actions. Nations have claimed they will attempt to conquer Luna and Mars, and the Hiachijanese people are worried of falling behind in the space race.

To combat this, we too, as Habna and Amaldrus have, made plans to claim Martian ground. Our main operation, however, is to achieve the seemingly impossible; conquer Venusian territory. In the past decades, Hiachijan has already launched numerous probes (similar in function/design to the Venera probes of the Soviets), some of which have obtained photographs of the Venusian surface, only to succumb to the planet's heat and pressure.

Right now, Hiachijan is spending billions of chaejis in an attempt to construct a specialized spacesuit and lander that are capable of dealing with several times the pressure and heat of the deepest trench on Earth. Hiachijan is highly doubtful it will ever reach this goal, but they believe that anything is worth a try.
