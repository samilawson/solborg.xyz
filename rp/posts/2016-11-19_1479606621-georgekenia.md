Posted by: georgekenia

Nations involved: Georgekenia, and possibly neighbors.

Brody Smitters has been elected the neuw president of The Democratice Republice of Georgekenia,
He is a twentey-three year man.
He say he is going to be a internationel frend.,
except he has a odd extra desire.
He desire neighboring nations' English classs to teach Georgekenian English, naught American or Brittish...
This is much insignificent...except to the teacher of thoose countries who would hate to explains new conjugations and spellings no matter hauw slight.
