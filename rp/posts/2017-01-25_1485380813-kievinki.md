Nations involved: Kievinki

Varvi, Mertsi OY's largest diamond mine in Siberia, was officially opened on Wednesday and is set to yield about 54 million carats of rough diamonds from around 35 million tonnes of scheduled material over its lifetime.


A special ceremony was held to celebrate the occasion, with VIP guests flying in to the site at Mirny on the Siberian taiga, 1 170km west of Jakutsk, capital of the Siberian Territories.

The open-pit mine, the worldâ€™s largest new diamond mine for 13 years, is a joint venture between Mertsi OY (61%) and the Kievinkian Government (VMK). Mertsi OYs investment is about 500 million mks.

First ore was exposed at Varvi on 23 September 2016, and the project remains on track to reach full commercial operation in the first quarter of 2017.

The mine consolidates Mertsi OYs 20-year history in the region and will ensure Kievinki remains as a good rough diamond producer by value in the world.  


The opening follows a report that indicates the mine is set to provide a 6.7 billion mk lift to the Kievinkian economy and has already led to a 440 million mk boost to the Siberian Territories economy.
