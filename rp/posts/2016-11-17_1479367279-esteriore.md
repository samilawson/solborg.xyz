# ECO: Concerning 

Posted by: esteriore

Nations involved: WSCN, NOPS

Esteriore is offering to financially support nations that join WSCN. Funding for schools, hospitals, and more if any nation joins the WSCN. They will also be protected by attacks from other nations in Norrland if tensions escalate. Each nation will recieve a monthly payment based on their financial situation. This will in turn grow the regional power the nation has.

We certainly hope that nations pick a side in this conflict. I have tremendous respect for all nations. Both sides have their ups and downs, but this is a decision all nations will have to make. NOPS, WSCN or Neutrality. I respect the decisions of all nations of Norrland and cannot wait to see what the future holds for all nations.
