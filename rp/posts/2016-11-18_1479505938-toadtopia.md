Nations involved: Toadtopia, anyone who cares

President Ernman announced today that Toadtopia will do everything in their power to stay out of foreign conflict not directly affecting the nation. In addition to this, the nation will do everything in its means to continue focusing on domestic policy. 

The spokesperson of the Congress of Toadtopia reaffirmed this message and added by saying, "We are still more than willing to cooperate with other nations, but only if our domestic policies align, and conflicts are kept out of discussion."
