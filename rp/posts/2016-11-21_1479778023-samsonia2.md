# GEN: BREAKING: SAMSONIA2 CONSIDERING LEAVING NOPS, ELECTING NEW PRIME MINISTER

Posted by: samsonia2

Nations involved: Samsonia2, solborg

Samsonia2 is now considering leaving the NOPS, as it restricts their autonomy as a nation as well as having minimal benefits. The alternative solution proposed is to start a trade union, with trade benefits to all nations but no loss of autonomy.
The vote has been added to the ballots in the all-important elections, which will occur within the next 12 hours. The elections currently going on are:
Prime Minister: SamsonXIV (Security for our Nation, Once and For All!), incumbent, vs. Thomas Hardy (Peace through Prosperity), challenger -- Polls indicate 2% lead for SamsonXIV
Samsonia2 City Mayor: SamsonXV(I am not my father, but I am!) vs. Guillerimo Lopez (No more of the same!), incumbent retired -- Polls show dead heat
