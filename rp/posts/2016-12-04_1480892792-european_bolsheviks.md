Posted by: european_bolsheviks

Nations involved: European Bolsheviks, New Telemark, Al Ghaza

The Revolutionary Worker's Council has released a statement regarding the recent WOV resistance in New Telemark. Representative Pyotr Arashenko said that "the NOPS has no right to intervene in Al Ghaza", and that "the West's continued influence over the east warrants violent action." 

However, the Revolutionary Council for Ideology has warned that any known religious extremists spotted within European Bolshevik borders will be executed, and any citizens linked to religious extremism will be apprehended by secret police.

The Revolutionary Council for Security has announced that the USSEB's borders will be closed indefinitely in preparation for the national audit on January 1st.
