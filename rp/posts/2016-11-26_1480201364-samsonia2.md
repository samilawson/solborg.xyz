# ALLIES: BREAKING: SAMSONIA2 OFFERS PEACE DEAL

Posted by: samsonia2

Nations involved: Samsonia2, Stockgrove, Ellenstedt, Odenreig, Kievinki, Gullandia, New Woking, Samsonia3, Portmany Arms Base 

After long talks with the Supreme God-Emperor in Madagascar, Samsonia2 has offered an agreement that should hopefully appease the NOPS and Samsonia3. The breakdown and key parts of the treaty are below.

KEY OBJECTIVES

-End Fighting

-Mend longtime Feud between Samsonias

-Help Samsonia3 join the international community

-Disarm Samsonia3

REQUIREMENTS FOR NOPS AND SAMSONIA2

-Remove all Troops from Portmany

-Allow Samsonia3 Entry into NOPS

-Manage Samsonia3's Lone Nuclear Weapon (will be discussed in more detail)

REQUIREMENTS FOR SAMSONIA3:

-Hand over all chemical weapons

-Free all hostages

-Pay for reparations

-Issue formal apology

-Remove all nuclear weapons except for one, which will be under control of the NOPS

Our 'one-nuke' policy may seem dangerous, but since Samsonia3 has had these nukes for some time now, they more than likely know how to make them. If we tried to take them all, they could easily take a tiny bit of uranium from each nuke and then proceed to build new ones. This way, Samsonia3 can't complain about self defense but the NOPS controls the nuclear weapon. Samsonia3 seems to have come around and realized their mistakes, but they will still have to pay a hefty price.

Signed, SamsonXIV
