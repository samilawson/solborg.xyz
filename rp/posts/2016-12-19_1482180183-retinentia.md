# ALLIANCE: Retinentia and Troiya Form "ProCo," Urge Others to Join

Posted by: retinentia

Nations involved: Troiya, Retinentia

Prime Minister Paxton Blue of Retinentia has been spotted entering the Troiyan Chancellor's offices earlier this afternoon, his Cabinet officials following close behind. He has since confirmed the rumors of a military and economic alliance.

"As sad as it is to admit, Norrland is on the brink of nuclear war. It is in the best interest of Retinentia and Troiya to set aside our political and personal differences and work together to ensure our survival. We--Chancellor Jeckson [of Troiya] and I--acknowledge this fact," Blue said about the newfound relationship. 

The Progressive Coalition, named for its liberal and pacifist values, plans to stay out of the war, but, as Prime Minister Blue pointed out during his interview, "desperate times call for desperate measures."

Any nation that follows the ideals held by the alliance may ask to join by sending a telegram to the offices of Retinentia right away.
