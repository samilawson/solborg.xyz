# GEN: Samsonia2 looks To the Stars... and the West... and the North and South

Posted by: samsonia2

Nations involved: Samsonia2

Samsonia2 has taken a 180 degree turn on it's previous stance on space research. A manned mission to the moon could be in the works with a joint Samsonia2-Samsonia3 crew, a diplomatic breakthrough! 

On another note, Samsonia2 has expressed interest in exploring North and South America. These lands could bring riches to their discoverer. Finally, Samsonia2 has a proposal for the NOPS. They want a NOPS and Samsonia2-sponsored expedition to the south (and afterwards the north) pole. These expeditions will surely reap rewards, and especially help us with scientific advancement in the field of terraforming.
