# : Our Glorious Leaders Responce To This New Rebellion

Posted by: samascanbown

Nations involved: Samascanbown

I, as this leader of this glorious nation, must respond to this act of... Radicalism. All I have to say is that the land that will not be stated that the rebels currently occupy, will be swiftly taken back, because if I must stay here to put down this rebellion down myself, and if I cannot trust my military to put this down, I will miss my opportunity to receive high quality cake from the wedding I am going to tomorrow, and by god if I need to stay here because of security reasons, by damn there will be hell to pay. I will have cake!
