# GEN: Marion responds to recent events

Nations involved: NOPS Nations, WSNC Nations

"Norrland is currently in a very unstable state. It's a very tricky situation" Says Carver Marion, Prime Minister of Esteriore, during an Interview.

"The alliance system is a time bomb, and I sincerely regret creating the WSCN. You have 2 mega-alliances held in Check by mutually assured destruction, constantly in fear of the other alliance. It's created an extremely bumpy and dangerous road in politics, and I'm not sure how to fix it. We could in theory disband the WSNC and NOPS, but that would create many internal conflicts in unstable nations, so either way, it's a horrible situation. Blood will be spilled, no doubt about it, but we can change how much blood does. I would like to meet with the Prime Minister of Solborg sometime soon to discuss this".
