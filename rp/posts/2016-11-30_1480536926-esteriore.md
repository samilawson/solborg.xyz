# GEN: Disease Waterborne

Posted by: esteriore

Nations involved: North American Nations

It has just been discovered that the strain of Influenza discovered in Esteriore has contaminated the great lakes. It is suspected that many, if not all nations bordering the great lakes are now infected with the illness. Bottled water is currently being dispensed to the population, as most water running in the nation's taps is from the great lakes.

The death toll has risen to over 1400 and the number of reported cases is a whopping 49,600 in Esteriore alone. We ask lakes nearby the now infected ones be left alone.
