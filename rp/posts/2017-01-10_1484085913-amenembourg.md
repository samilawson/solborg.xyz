# ECO: Stock Market Fluctuations and Economic partnership

Posted by: amenembourg

Nations involved: Amenembourg, Esteriore, Solborg

The financial crisis that began in Europe and spread to North America did not bother the Amenembourgian government.

Indeed, economic relations and trade with Esteriore were very limited following sanctions that had been taken by the Amenembourgian authorities.

Still, financial analysts from investment companies recently asked the High Authority for the Regulation of Financial Markets about growing speculation on European currencies and North American sovereign debts.

As a result, the High Authority has ordered the consolidation of the capital of banks with major financial commitments in Europe and North America.

At the same time, the Amenembourgian Central Bank insisted on reassuring amenembourgian savers on the soundness of the national banking system, which has never fared so well with national economic growth of the GDP. A GDP mainly carried by the real economy and not by finance, which instead of gain in volume has gained strength, stability and net worth.

Pending the end of the Solborg elections, the Amenembourgian government is delighted to have begun discussions on an economic partnership that would benefit both nations.
