* note due to the loss of the ability to make nukes as issued here Georgekenia will repurpose its program to create a defensive system much less offensive to nations such as Adrea and Samsonia3, nuclear chemical and biological weapons are off limits so Georgekenia will reasearch alternative methods such as kinetic bombardment and normal misles, so Geogekenia could atleast still achieve some of its goals without angering anyone.
