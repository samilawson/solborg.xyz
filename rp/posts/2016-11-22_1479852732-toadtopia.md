Posted by: toadtopia

Nations involved: Toadtopia

The Toadtopian Space Agency have announced a plan to launch their first satellite into space. Rocket tests are underway and the first satellite to be launched will practice basic orbital patterns and conduct basic tests in space. These tests will be minimal as other nations have plentiful research already published on this matter. The end goal is to have a satellite monitoring Earth's climate pattern: Basically Suomi with a TBD name - (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suomi_NPP).
