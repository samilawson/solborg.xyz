Nations involved: Cacusia, Centralstan

The Cacusian leader, who is in a hospital at ravens landing, miraculously is showing signs of recovering. The leader was shot earlier last week by a Centralstani terrorist. Centralstan has denied any involvement in the attack although they have not come forward with any new information. Cacusian intelligence says that it is still unknown if the Centralstani government carried out the operation. " For diplomatic purposes Cacusia will give Centralstan the benefit of the doubt until any incriminating information surfaces." says the leaders second,Kitt Zannah. The leader shall start to continue his/her work (the leader never is in public without a mask, and not much is known about him/her) from the hospital soon although he/she is not expected to make any public appearances until fully recovered. The lower rib cage has been somewhat reconstructed and the spleen is healing. He/she shall remain in the subterranean capitol of Ravens Landing until full recovery.
