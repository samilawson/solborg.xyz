# DISASTER: Demands and Humanitarian Efforts

Posted by: solborg

Nations involved: Solborg, ICU, Vladstok, Gal May, Ellenstedt, Vreekomfdod, European Bolsheviks

In reaction to the recent catastrophy in the European Bolsheviks, a number of nations in NOPS will be sending a coordinated humanitarian mission to the country. Aid workers from the Solborgian UMO, Canadian HC, Vladstokian LHP, and AP of Gal May will be escorted into the Bolsheviks by the Ellenstedtian army to help treat victims of the nuclear fallout. All soldiers and medical workers will be provided with protective clothing. NOPS Secretary General Jans Åkesson dismissed the Bolshevik allegations of responsibility by calling them "a clever piece of propaganda, and equally utter nonsense" as no inspectors have yet reached the country since the deal is still pending NOPS approval.

Åkesson has also demanded that the Bolsheviks immediately suspend all nuclear enrichment and shut down all nuclear facilities. Solborgian spy satellites are being positioned to monitor the nation to ensure cooperation. A previously planned joint military exercise between a number of NOPS nations is currently being conducted in Vreekomfdod.
