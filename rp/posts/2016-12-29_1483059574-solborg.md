The PM of Solborg has announced that the country will be accepting refugees displaced by the conflict if the referendum to establish a board of immigration security passes (current polls show a 78% majority of the population are in favor of the measure; voting takes place on the 14th and 15th of January). Immigrants would be housed among Solborgians and required to learn Swedish and assimilate into Solborgian society. He harshly criticized the governments of Habna and Georgekenia, saying "I would never have expected to hear such disgusting, ignorant blanket statements, not even from them. I would expect more insight from a child."
