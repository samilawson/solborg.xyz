# GEN: Centralstan urges Cacusians withdrawal.

Posted by: centralstan

Nations involved: Centralstan

The Cacusians colonization not only takes advantage of the weak independent Nepali villagers but honestly seems to be directed a rivaling Centralstan's influence in Central Asia so Dick Tayor has issued a urgency for the Cacusians to give Nepal independence.
"If Central and otherwise nearby parts of Asia are to become political playgrounds, they will become as such by our hand, not by a European nation who is exercising Millitary power they don't have."
