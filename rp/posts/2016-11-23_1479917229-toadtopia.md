Posted by: toadtopia

Nations involved: Toadtopia 

The TSA's first satellite has entered orbit around Earth. The mission was an overall success with basic experiments performed. Toadtopia's first images of Earth were also made. The satellite has been named Simple for obvious reasons. 

The next step for Toadtopian scientists is to make instruments to monitor Earth's climate. This includes temperature monitoring, ozone level measure, pressure and moisture monitors, an infrared measure, and finally, a radiation monitor.
