# WAR: Samsonia3 Clarifies Messages

Posted by: samsonia3

Nations involved: Samsonia3, Esteriore

Samsonia3 shall clarify the messages they sent one by one:

If we choose to invade the Bolsheviks, that frees up NOPS members to get involved in whichever way they choose. Not necessarily punishable under the deal.

A nuke is always an option, but we are weighing what would cost more lives. We want as little blood to be shed as possible. If Samsonia3 does drop a nuke on the Bolsheviks, it will be the nuke recovered from Esteriore's old cache. Ironic, no? But this idea is very unlikely, as nukes are bad for everyone unless used as leverage, as they are being used now.

Finally, the idea of marching through Adrea was explored, but not without consent. Samsonia3 is currently communicating with them. If they deny, we shall ask all other nations neighboring the Bolsheviks for passage. If they deny... well, see the paragraph above.

-Best Wishes,

The Supreme God-Emperor of Samsonia3
