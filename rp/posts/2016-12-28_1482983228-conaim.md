# MORMON WAR: Conaim thanks New Nexon and all other allies

Posted by: conaim

Nations involved: Conaim, New Nexon, Esteriore, Others

The president of Conaim thanks all helpful nations of the world for ending the Mormon War, and also it's own soldiers as well.
However losing an entire demographic may have some effects on Conaimese life but luckily many of those are positive.

Esteriore has agreed to take all Mormons in the nation to a resettlement colony on Baffin Island, we don't know if this colony will be independent or a part of Esteriore.

The few remaining Mormons in Vladimirstan will most likely dissapear from mind and become insignificant...
Maybe Vladimirstan's silent strategy has some perks.
