Posted by: karlsfell

Nations involved: Karlsfell, Magnificent Wadiya

Robert Apellsson, Minister of Foreign Affairs along with Energy Chancellor Alexius Plegum recently announced in a national energy conference that the Kingdom is working on pursuing oil investments in Magnificent Wadiya. The national energy leaders are interested in making all energy in The Kingdom 100% government owned and operated, and through the 

Wadiyan oil drilling can focus on creating that goal and achieving it. Of the 9 energy council members, only 8 are in support of investing in oil as a continued source of energy but the remaining individual is focused on renewable energy. Mr. Plegum did say "We will work on using the oil we gain to power the machinery used in building alternate energy providers, as we can not power the machinery with alternatives as all alternative plants are being built. When we have enough fossil energy to power our machinery we will cease drilling and pull our operation from Wadiya as to convert fully to 100% renewable free energy. This will be a great stepping stone in our nations economy, job industry, and energy history." Mr. Plegum does feel confident and ready to get the oil needed and disband the operation in a smooth and seamless manner.
