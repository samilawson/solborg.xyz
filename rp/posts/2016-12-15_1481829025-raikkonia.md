# AID: Raikkonia initiates foreign aid program

Posted by: raikkonia

Nations involved: Raikkonia

With tensions seeming to rise, Raikkonia has sought to brighten things up by announcing involvement in foreign aid.

"This is not about politics," stressed leader Korpela. "This is about ensuring the welfare of humans around the world, particularly any innocents who happen to get caught in conflict.
"We're not looking to start any trouble. If aid is declined, we will not force it on a country. In respect to this, we urge outside forces not to become enraged over any aid offered. Again, this is not about assisting in conflicts, but about helping save lives."

Raikkonia is noted for its large welfare programs.
Raikkonia had also been noted by its "everyone's friend" policy under Korpela's rule, attempting to remain peaceful as well as friendly to other nations.
