Posted by: european_bolsheviks

Nations involved: European Bolsheviks, Fascist Adrea, Kataria

In response to recent discoveries made by Katarian satellites, the European Bolshevik’s Revolutionary Worker’s Council has released a statement regarding the affair. 

In an interview with Official State News, Pyotr Arashenko told reporters that "the Ministry of Interior is well aware of Iaerme’s aggressive actions” and that “the council is devising a plan to counter any nuclear strike” initiated by Adrea.

The People’s Republic’s southern border, which it shares with the Fascist Nation, has been at the forefront of political tensions between the two countries since last week. The establishment of a controversial border wall began as a result of Adrea’s “continuing, yet futile efforts to overthrow the European Bolshevik government” says Arashenko.

However, according to the Department of Infrastructure, the project has been halted in order to “re-evaluate the construction cost”, which may exceed the socialist-nation’s financial capabilities, noted European Bolshevik Economist Andreas Pchoff as he was being carried off by Secret Police.
