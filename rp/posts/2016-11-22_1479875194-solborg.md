Posted by: solborg

Nations involved: NOPS, Samsonia2

The Secretary General of NOPS has raised the threat level to nine out of ten, indicating an extreme emergency, since the invasion of Portnamy by Samsonia2 and others. He called the event "unfortunate and risky, but ultimately necessary." 9000 of the 15,000 peacekeeping troops in Esteriore have been relocated to Samsonia2 for defensive purposes only. The remaining 6000 are awaiting assignment.
