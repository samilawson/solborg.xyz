The Symbol of Nerisis has announced her decision today to attach 60 operatives as advisors to the peacekeeping mission in Esteriore. This is a huge development as this kind of commitment to any peacekeeping mission has never been made by Nerisis. In the war against Gobwin Knob they only contributed 15 operatives, 3 of whom still occupy the capitol of the former nation, and when Anarchtopiastan was in revolt 17. One can only suspect that they may have some ulterior motive for sending so many troops to the now bustling Western Hemisphere. We have confirmed that they are intended to be attached to a deployment from Solborg or Firge, but it remains to be seen. 

Also in the speech the Symbol criticized Katari President Oswell and Secretary Arriah for allowing Stanley Garson, former Overlord of Gobwin Knob, to leave exile in Hiachijan without being detected by the "watchful eye" of the Top Secret Katari Satellite Surveillance Program. Garson's current location is unknown. President Oswell and Secretary Arriah along with the rest of the Katari government have yet to respond to these accusations.
