# MORMONS: Presidential Statement on Ellen Attack

Posted by: vladimirstan

Nations involved: Vladimirstan, Conaim

I would like to extend my deepest sympathies to the people of Conaim in the wake of the horrifying attack in Ellen. I have spoken with the President of Conaim in order to personally express my condolences. To be clear, the Sons of Utah, the group that executed this attack, is a terrorist group that does not speak for Mormonism or any other religion. The vast majority of Mormons are tolerant people who would never imagine of carrying out such an act. In order to protect all Vladimirstanians, I will ask our intelligence community to take steps to ensure that the Sons of Utah and their twisted ideology will never permeate Vladimirstan.
