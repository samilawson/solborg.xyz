# OIL: Oil Pipeline Spills Crude into Major River

Posted by: mandalae

Nations involved: Mandalae

The infamous Gavern Co. Oil Pipeline has spilled 10 million gallons of oil into one of Mandalae's most famous rivers, the Truckee.

The pipeline, which has been a topic of fierce debate between environmentalists and oil supporters alike, was built in 1976. It had been set to shut down next year because of its age.

Although the spill is mostly contained, within one section of the river, it has renewed calls for a complete ban on the use of oil within Mandalae, which already has strict environmental policies.
