Posted by: democratic_republic_of_cacusia

Nations involved: Troia, New Yorkia, Ialicus, Vladstok, and NOPS

In a speech made in Lhasa in the Cacusian colony, Cacusian leadership called for an end to the Troian/Yorkian conflict.      "Cacusia feels that this war has gone far enough and it must be stopped. Cacusia will not take sides and our military will remain neutral but we are making a plea for peace that must not be ignored. This war has already started to spread, earlier today Vladstok announced its involvement. The spread of war must not be allowed. peace must be restored before the war spreads any further. If peace is not reinstated how long before the horror of war spreads to the fest of Norrland? We must avoid a region wide  conflict at all costs. Peace must return as soon as possible or the flames of war shall begin to devour our great region, an occurrence which all residents of Norrland hopefully want to avoid. we hope both sides consider the repercussions of the decisions they are making."
