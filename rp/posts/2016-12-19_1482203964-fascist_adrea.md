# WAR: Adrea Offers Peace

Posted by: fascist_adrea

Nations involved: Fascist Adrea, European Bolsheviks, Esteriore

An inspiring speech given by Iaerme Pales, who was speaking from an undisclosed location on the frontline via internet feed, discussed how quickly the Bolshevik lines fell, and how the Adrean forces, supported by the great armies of Esteriore and the AAF, crushed all opposition without issue. She stated that the war was so pathetic, that she's only offering peace out of pity.

In a quote from Iaerme; "The Adrean nation wants nothing more than a Balkan hegemony, to unite Krağadrijia, the land promised to Adrea by the great Dezső, and it starts with Dezső's homeland- Hungary."

Adrean diplomats have offered to the European Bolsheviks a treaty on the following terms:

- The Demarcation line through Budapest is set along the Danube river, as opposed to an arbitrary line

- All Hungarian territory west of the Danube and up to the town of Szeged are ceded to Adrea

- The Bolsheviks denounce the use of, and dismantle any and all nuclear weapons within their borders, with a maximum of 1 left for self defence.

- A reparation fee of 30 thousand Novas ($33,729) is given to Adrea, and another fee worth 50 thousand Novas ($56,215) will be payed to Esteriore.

- Any citizens may freely travel between Adrea and the E.B, without cost.

- Bolsheviks are not allowed to build any defensive structure anywhere within 50 miles of the Adrean border with the exclusion of Watchtowers, Roadblocks, Customs, or Guardposts.
