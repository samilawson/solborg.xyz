# GE: USSEB Department of Travel enforces stricter border control

Posted by: european_bolsheviks

Nations involved: All

In order to regulate and mitigate the influx of travelers after the war, the newly established Department of Travel has declared that it is going to tighten border security by implementing stricter regulation.

Along with the requirement to provide passport identification, all foreign entrants must also supply a valid entry permit, which can be acquired by contacting the European Bolshevik Department of Travel Office for Entry Permits. 

Visa stamps are also needed to surpass passport control, and can be obtained via in-person application at the border. 

All travelers from Fascist Adrea must enter through the checkpoint in Budapest. Adreans in transit through the USSEB may be admitted at other access points.

The European Bolshevik Party assures Fascist Adrea that this decree does not violate the peace agreement between the two nations, since these requirements are solely meant to prevent the admission of vagabonds with forged documentation and other unwelcome persons.
