# GEN: False alarm

Posted by: esteriore

Nations involved: Esteriore

Big mistake on part of Esteriore. It turns out the disease has not infected the great lakes. It was a completely different illness. The mix up was caused by a mis-organization of flasks in a research center. The Influenza however, is still infecting thousands.

We are very sorry for this mistake. The water is NOT contaminated. But still be wary of the current illness spreading in our country.
