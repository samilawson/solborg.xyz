BREAKING NEWS: Samsonia2 has launched a massive Offsensive on Portmany Island, where Samsonia3 is holding their nuclear weaponry. 75,000 Samsonian troops have been scattered across the island, with gunfire erupting everywhere. The 2,500 NOPS troops have also been deployed. Samsonia2 is also being backed with reinforcements from Stockgrove, Ellenstedt, Odenreig, Kievinki, Gullandia, and New Woking. The reinforcements will land on the slightly southern island of Pujols, where a base has been established, and quickly join the fighting in Portmany. Currently, Prime Minister SamsonXIV, who was making a speech to the natives of Morocco, has been taken to a private bunker. More news to come soon.

"The gunfire is everywhere! You can't tell who is even who! Right Now Samsonia3 is putting up a solid defense, but as reinforcements come in, the outcome should be very up in the air! And now the ground is rumbling like some kind of earthquake! So much going on in such a small island!"
