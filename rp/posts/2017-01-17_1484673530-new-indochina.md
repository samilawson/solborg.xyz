# POLITICAL: Terrorist attack on Elected Prime Minister

Nations involved: New-Indochina, Retinetia, (New-Indochinese Australia)

A day after Governmental and Congress elections, New-Indochina is shocked, after a terrorist attack happened on the Binnenhof. The main target of the attack was the newly elected Prime Minister, Tran Thanh Vu.

The culprit has fled to our colony New-Indochinese Australia, and he is one of the members of the secessionist movement AIP(Australian Independence Party) and he is still being wanted.

The elected Prime Minister is unharmed, as he could quickly leave the Binnenhof after the culprit entered the Binnenhof.


This also changed the relationships with our colony Australia, as it didn't wanted to extradite, nor helping the New-Indochinese troops. The autonomous colony, is now being placed under the direct authority of our Government, making a new Department.

We'll hope that we will find him in Australia, as there were plans found in his house to flee to Retinetia, where our troops and Police force don't have permission to cross the borders.

Research is being done, and there will be a telegram sent to Retinetia for permission for our forces to cross the border and arrest the terrorist, if we have proof that he actually fled to Retinetia.
