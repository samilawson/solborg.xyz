Posted by: new_nexon

Nations involved: New Nexon, Solborg, Amenembourg 

The Mars rover Shanghai, which was launched by Nexon last year, had just landed on Mars. The launching of the rover was widely speculated to be a part of Nexon's ambitious space programmes. However, it was also speculated that the formerly isolationist country is working with some other countries with high technological levels too.
