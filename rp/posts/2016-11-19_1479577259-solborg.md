Posted by: solborg

Nations involved: Solborg, Stockgrove, Ellenstedt, NOPS

The Solborgian PM, appearing at a press conference with a caste on his left arm, addressed the nation today after the second assassination attempt since the beginning of his term in September 2015. Security has been heightened dramatically around government buildings and for government members, this being the second large security beefing since the attacks in Tammerfors by the WOV in August. He encouraged Solborgians to stay strong but also prepared for the worst. The governments of Solborg, Stockgrove, and Ellenstedt have also voted to join the recently founded EEO.

The Secretary General of NOPS has, in the ongoing state of emergency, ordered the stationing of 2500 NOPS troops along the southern coast of Odenreig and the Mediterranean coast of Betiutia. 500 troops have also been sent to New Woking to assist with training and border security.
