Posted by: amaldrus

Nations involved: Habna, Amaldrus

Amaldrus is now an independent country from Habna,
They did not want the economic burden of their hoe,land after the Habnian Civil war, 560,000 people fled to Amaldrus during the war and Amaldrus is willing to take some more but not too many as Amaldrus despite being ethnically Habnian is also small, and does not want to expand for now.

Using the money Amaldrus has saved, Amaldrus will strengthen its own army to prevent any tragedies like in Habna and changed policy to improve inter class relations.
Amaldrus also is funding a joint Space program between them and Habna.

The sharing of a space program between Amaldrus and Habna is what finally ,are Habna accept Amaldrussiam Independence,

The new space base called Ethnicly Habnian Space Program (EHSP) is being built on the far northeast island in Amaldrus (also known as Tobago) though it is still part of Amaldrussian territory Habna will be allowed easier access to the island than the rest of Amaldrus, this also means that immirgating from Habna to the island is easier than immigrating to anywhere else in Amaldrus.
