# GEN: Slendergradian Army and Paramilitaries Lay Siege to Waynesborg

Posted by: slendergrad

Nations involved: Slendergrad

After the Slenderofascist Party and its supporters took control over the town of Waynesborg and several other nearby towns, the Slendergradian Army and the Defence Companies (so-called because they are responsible for defending the government) put Waynesborg under siege. 

So far, there seems to be a statement in the battles between the extremists and government forces. However, the 16,000 strong government troops are expected to be reinforced by a further 17,000. Observers claimed that they saw tanks, armoured fighting vehicles and attack helicopters heading towards the town. Around 350 deaths have been estimated for now.
