Posted by: new-indochina

Nations involved: New-Indochina

The New-Indochinese Congress has enacted a new act about a Space Mission.

This will mean, that there will be an apart Ministry for Space and there will be a new Space Agency founded, the AASA (Asian and Australian Space Agency).

All other Asian and Australian/Oceanian nations are able to join the Space Agency (Only nations in Asia, not European/American nations with Asian/Oceanian territories). This will mean, that the nations can produce Space Rockets, Space Stations and are able to send Astronauts of their own nation into space.

Launch stations are being built in places in Victoria and Queensland, and any other nation that joins the AASA is able to build launch stations on their nation's territory.
