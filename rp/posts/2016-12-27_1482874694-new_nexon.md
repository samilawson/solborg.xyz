"Space is the only frontier left, and as humans, we are natural-born explorers. We have been so since time immemorial and we shall explore this frontier of limitless opportunities," the Imperial Decree issued by His Imperial Majesty Emperor Slender read. "After our country launched astronaut Gerry Jones, Michael Lim and Alan Wang into space on 3th August 1976, we have made little achievement in space exploration. We shall reignite this spark and explore the place where our future lies, starting with our natural satellite and the planets nearest to us."
