# WAR: Hiachijan Declares Neutrality

Posted by: hiachijan

Nations involved: Hiachijan, Esteriore, European Bolsheviks, Fascist Adrea

With the conflicts between Esteriore, Fascist Adrea and the European Bolsheviks, the Alventocracy has declared itself neutral for the time being.

While we are highly approving of the European Bolsheviks' communist ideologies, we will be willing to defend Esteriore from further threats should these conflicts escalate any higher.

In other news, Hiachijan's golden age has yet to end.
