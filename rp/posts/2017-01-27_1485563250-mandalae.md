# TANK: Mandalae Unveils New Assault Tank: the AV-4A

Posted by: mandalae

Nations involved: Mandalae

The Mandalean military just unveiled the new assault tank that will be used throughout the armed forces: the AV-4A.

The AV-3C, which has been used since the early 1970s, was proven to be far too outdated and lackluster in its performance, which was all the more clear during the Mandalaean takeover of Borneo.

The AV-4A is equipped with a 90mm main armament, and can travel up to 85 kph. It is designed to easily maneuver in and out of combat, and its low profile enables it to hide behind cover.

Images of the AV-4A can be seen here:
