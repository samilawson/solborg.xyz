The Secretary General of NOPS, Jans Ã…kesson, has reassigned 5500 of the 6000 remaining peacekeeping troops in Esteriore to assist with the creation of treatment centers for the victims of the biological attack on Portnamy. The military base in Cagliari is still under construction, although it is now fit to accept planes with NOPS troops. Ellenstedt is sending 16,000 troops to the base in re-purposed Airbus A380s. They will remain in Cagliari until further plans are made.
