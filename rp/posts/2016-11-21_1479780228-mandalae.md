Nations involved: Mandalae

The Western Republic of Mandalae announced this morning that it will be establishing a permanent colony on Mars in the coming months.

This annoncement comes after a significant increase in Mandalaean space spending, as well as wild speculation about the government's intentions in ramping up technological advancements across the nation.

The Mandalean government is currently looking for 10 citizens who will be sent as the initial colonists, with more colonists arriving on Mars soon after.
