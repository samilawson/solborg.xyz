Nations involved: Austrian Habsburgs, Kolam Brotherhood

Following the recent disastrous events in the Kolam Brotherhood, the small Baltic Nation of Austrian Habsburgs has offered aid to the Kolami population.

Prime-Minister Karl Fischer stated that "we would like to provide aid to citizens affected by the Volcanic eruption, but only with permission from the Kolami government."

YouTuber Sid Toosoon's ratings in Austrian Habsburgs have fallen to an all-time low, as a result of his distasteful comments about the unfortunate natural disasters.
