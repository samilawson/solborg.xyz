# WAR: Whats Next?

Posted by: democratic_republic_of_cacusia

Nations involved: New Nexon, New Indochina, New Yorkia, Mandalae, Troiya, Imperial Canadian Union, NOPS

The war against Troiya is expected to be over soon. This creates the question "what comes next". Those involved need to find out how territory will be divided up,  how rebuilding efforts will be operated and how they will pay off any debts from the war. These are questions that should be answered, preferably sooner rather than later. We must not leave areas to anarchy and allow possible terrorist groups to arise. plans must be laid out that will prevent terrorism in the areas affected and borders must be drawn. we must ensure that peace is maintained.
