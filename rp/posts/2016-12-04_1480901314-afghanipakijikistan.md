# WOV: Afghanipakijikistan supports the WOV

Posted by: afghanipakijikistan

Nations involved: Afghanipakijikistan, Al Ghaza, New Telemark

Sheikh Muhammad Ameen recently gave a speech on Afghanipaki national television, stating that the "the Violetists actions in New Telemark were righteous in nature" and that "the global resistance against the West's reign over the east has begun." He also said that many Afghanipakijikistanis have left their homeland to fight with the Violetists in Al-Ghaza, and any violence committed by NOPS against them would be a "declaration of war against Afghanipakijikistan."

The Sultan Ahmed Abdullah Abu al-Fawaris has not commented on the attacks and is still living in seclusion inside the Royal Palace with his 27 wives.
