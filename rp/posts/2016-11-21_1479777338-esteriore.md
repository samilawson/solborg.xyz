# JRS: Ceasefire

Posted by: esteriore

Nations involved: Esteriore, NOPS

Esteriore will cease pushing farther into Betiutia for the moment. We agree fully with Solborg that this should be resolved quickly and diplomatically. 

We are also considering joining NOPS. We're currently trying to build a completely new image, starting with a new flag and joining NOPS. We also plan to open foreign embassies with numerous countries.
