# GEN: Hispatian Military Finally Settles Down

Posted by: hispatia

Nations involved: Hispatia, Esteriore

Long after the events of Esteriore's attempted invasion of the Panama Canal, the Hispatian military is finally calming itself down. Hispatian soldiers are no longer seen patrolling the border nor towns every hour, and fly-by's are far less common, the change occurring over night. It's very likely that now-in-command, Presidente Rodrigo Peridido, gave the stand-down order, seeing that the military was simply wasting supplies as the nation was now safe from any sort of invasion. As per his Welfare-Partido leanings, he has also reduced military funding to pay for many different soup kitchens across Hispatia.
