# ECONOMY: Nexon to Aid in Recession

Posted by: new_nexon

Nations involved: New Nexon, Others

In response to the worldwide economic recession, His Imperial Majesty Emperor Slender stated that Nexon, which has been relatively unscathed from the shockwaves, will aid other countries by providing them with financial help. If necessary, Nexonan companies will be encouraged to buy out foreign, insolvent companies in extreme conditions, for example countries with high unemployment rates and too many employees may be laid off by said insolvent companies. States in need are asked to reach out to the Nexonan government, as they really wanted to help others.
