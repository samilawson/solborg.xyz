Posted by: the_kolam_brotherhood

Nations involved: The Kolam Brotherhood, Mandalae

The Kolami Armies in the mountains are hiding out in locations unknown. The Kolam Brotherhood also sends fleets to protect the capital. The Kolam Brotherhood is world renowned for its navy, as the majority of its budget was spent on it. Many think that the leader of the Kolam Brotherhood was backing the Conservatives in The Kolam Brotherhood to show support in the election. Almost all the other candidates frown upon the recent decision. Following this, the Anglyndian Regent was impeached, and the vice Regen, Berry Shaw, will take charge of the nation for the next ten minutes. Many expect that the next Kolami leader will withdrawal armies in Mandalae.

Also in the news is the Kolami elections. The Kolam Brotherhood uses a Instant-Runoff Voting System. This means that it takes a bit longer to count the votes, but it gets a more represented result. Many expect the Federationalists to win.
