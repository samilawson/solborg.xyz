# GEN: Amaldrus puts flight limitations

Posted by: amaldrus

Nations involved: Amaldrus, Esteriore

Until this uncertain threat of Esterian flu, no planes will be able to fly from Esteriore to Amaldrus, however the other way around is still allowed.
Amaldrus will aid its crippled mother country, Habna, in creating a new vaccine, but none of the money will be derived from the EHSP, instead money will be diverted from the police and fire stations of the country, along with higher taxes.
