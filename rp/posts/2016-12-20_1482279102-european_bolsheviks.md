Nations involved: European Bolsheviks

Following the PREB's defeat in the MOTHERLAND LIBERATION WAR, disheartened Soldiers, farmers, and industrial workers took to the streets of the capital, Lublin.

The corrupt Revolutionary Worker's Council dictatorship has been overthrown, and all ministries were dissolved. Government officials that were part of the war effort and members of "the old party" have been executed by the revolutionary youth via benevolent firing squads. 

The corrupt dictator Pyotr Arashenko was apprehended by the revolutionary guard this morning and will be brought before a tribunal of European Bolshevik partisans.

Official State Media has been replaced by Socialist Broadcasting, a television network supervised by the European Bolshevik party.

The Party has assumed complete control over all internal affairs.
