Galidian elders recall stories of horned horses being spotted and hunted to extinction in days past. The Galidian Tribeâ€™s records and archives make mention of a few unicorn hunts that took place a thousand years ago under the chieftain Aflaed Mockte, who sought to tame such a beast but was never successful, and in spite wiped out  any unicorn he could. 


It was reported that a neighboring people kept a herd of the beasts, but the stock was inferior due to generations of inbreeding and bad grazing lands. These people were eventually conquered and the inferior breed of unicorn was forgotten about until now, where it seems to have been traced to some caves.


DNA samples from this stock were found and extracted from a site that served as religious altar for pagan sacrifices. The samples come from a tooth that was found among the ancient ashes and charred remains. Several scientist reconstructed the DNA and provided an image of what the animal might look like.
