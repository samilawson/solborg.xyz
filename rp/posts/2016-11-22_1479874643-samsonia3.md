Nations involved: Samsonia2, Stockgrove, Ellenstedt, Odenreig, Kievinki, Gullandia, New Woking, Samsonia3, Portmany Arms Base 

Samsonia3 has begun to launch a massive counterpush on the island of portmany. If they can take the key landmark of Ibiza, they can make a perimeter on the island and shut it off to any type of foreign aid or assistance. The nation's superior military strength lends it a great hand in this battle. 
"Come on, GET TO IBIZA! WE CANNOT LET THE NOPS INTO THIS FIGHT! RIGHT NOW IT'S A 1 ON 1 FIGHT THAT WE WILL WIN! But if NOPS troops arrive, we will have to take even MORE drastic measures!"
