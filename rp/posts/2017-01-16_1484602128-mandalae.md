# ECO: Economic Reforms

Posted by: mandalae

Nations involved: Mandalae, Esteriore

After the recent global financial disaster, largely spurred by the unstable markets in Esteriore, President Hagden has announced his plans to increase economic stability and consumer protections.

"This is a volatile time we live in, in economic terms, with more and more people earning less and less. This was highlighted by the recent financial meltdown in Esteriore. However, with these new reforms implemented, the ultra-rich stock brokers and other market elites will be reigned in, and Mandalae will no longer be vulnerable to the kinds of economic turbulence we've seen in recent years."

The reforms are to take effect on February 1st, and are largely regulatory in nature.
