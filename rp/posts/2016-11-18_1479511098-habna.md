Posted by: habna

Nations involved: Habna, Amaldrus

In additif to honest that the Ethnic Habnians Space Program in Amaldrus has promise, Habna wil be building nuclear power plants in former war zones to make jobs, as well as increasing its nuclear arsenal to balance the international stage.
Habna currently only has 56 but plans to have 1000 by the end of 2017.
Of course some will be supplied to former colony Amaldrus as well as they have close ties.
Amaldrus is building a basic army and Haban is repairing its.
However neither nation wants war with anyone.
