# EMBARGO: Samsonia3 Denounces Esteriore and Update on Bolsheviks

Posted by: samsonia3

Nations involved: Samsonia3, esteriore, Bolsheviks

Samsonia3 denounces Esteriore's Embargo on them."We did not want the LRN to cause trouble. We just wanted our voices to be heard", said the Supreme God-Emperor. Fortunately, Samsonia3's Military-Industrial Complex is massive and should help shoulder the embargo. Another boon is that Samsonia3 cares little for their citizens as long as they are well-fed and strong, and since Samsonia3 has long since abandoned any environmental practices, the farming industry is doing quite well. 

On another note, upon further investigation, Stalinium does not exist. Unicorns are highly, highly unlikely, according to surveillance and intel from spies. This is just a publicity stunt from the Bolsheviks. If they claim to have developed a nuclear weapon, though, Samsonia3 may have no choice but to cripple this puny nation.
