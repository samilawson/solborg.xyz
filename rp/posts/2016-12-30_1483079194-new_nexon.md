Nations involved: New Nexon, Georgekenia, Afghanipakijikistan

After the wedding ceremony at Hiachijan ended, Emperor Slender flew back to Nexon in order to prepare for the next phase of the wedding in his homeland. In the meantime, His Imperial Majesty also allowed an initial amount of 3,000 refugees who were fleeing from the civil war currently erupting in Afghanipakijikistan. They were to be settled in the Nexonan colony of Nanyang and given jobs in plantations.

In addition, the country also condemned Georgekenia for its derogatory statements regarding the refugees. "I've never seen such an ignorant, brain-dead dingbat who managed to be elected to be the leader of his own country," the Emperor said.
