# WEATHER: Hurricane Nicolas, Christmas ruined

Posted by: amaldrus

Nations involved: Amaldrus, Hiachijian, New Telemark

A huge tropical storm has once again been detected by Amaldrussian sattelite, it will become a level 5 hurricane at landfall in Hiachijian and remain a 4 up until mid New telemark, or atleast that is the estimate.

Children cry as they know not even Rudolph could navigate under these extreme conditions, as this hurricane has a 50% of exceeding category 5, something unheard of
