# SPACE: Heat-Resistant Biosuits Undergo Testing

Nations involved: The Kolam Brotherhood

Scientists all over The Kolam Brotherhood are starting to research and test biotechnologically advanced spacesuits created to withstand heat. A newly discovered ore, Xustylon, has been found in plentitude around the Kolam Brotherhood, and has extremely good heat resistance. Xustylon only seems to be found in The Kolam Brotherhood and Skaan, although when found, it is in abundance. Xustylon combined with Aluminum created a lightweight flexible material that was very heat resistant.  Adding this to previous advanced biosuits could create an amazing scientific breakthrough in space technology. Engineers are currently assembling heat resistant suit prototypes and results will be in on Tuesday.
