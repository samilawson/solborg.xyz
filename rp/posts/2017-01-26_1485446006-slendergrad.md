# GEN: Archer Lee to be Inaugurated In Two Days

Posted by: slendergrad

Nations involved: Slendergrad, New Nexon, all countries

The current President of Slendergrad, Archer Lee, will be officially inaugurated as the President in a ceremony to be held at the Palace of Sydney, which is the temporary residence and workplace of the President (as well as an official retreat for the President) while the unnamed Presidential Palace's construction is still underway. The Foreign Ministry cordially invites every country in Norrland to send a representative to attend the ceremony.

However, it is not clear if the Nexonan Emperor Slender will be attending the inauguration. Traditionally, every Slendergradian President's inauguration was attended by the Nexonan Emperor himself as the Constitution (even the current one)  stipulates that the President has to be sworn in by the Nexonan Emperor in order to be the legitimate President. Given the recent massacre of Waynesborg and the military coup Archer organised to rise to the Presidency, it is not known if the Emperor will be attending or boycotting the event.
