# TERROR: Further Reclarification

Posted by: centralstan

Nations involved: Centralstan, Cacusia

The government of Centralstan has updated facts on some accusations made by both sides

1. Centralstan never accused Cacusia of abusing its citizens, rather just wanting extra territory in odd places.

2. While the attacker may had been a Centralstani that does not automatically mean it's our governments fault. While we are strict here we do not have full control over our citizens, they can leave our great nation and do stuff without us knowing.

However Centralstan has thought of a compromise that could be made;
Centralstan will,arm up to Cacusia of they instead of perm antler owning the colony, converted it into a program to make the Himalayan region a productive first world economy and when it is strong enough, it could be granted independence.
This could take decades so Cacusia could still "claim" the area for quite some time.
