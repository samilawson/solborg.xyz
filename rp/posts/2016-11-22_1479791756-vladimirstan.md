# JRS: Presidential Statement on the Conflict in Jerusalem

Posted by: vladimirstan

Nations involved: Betiutia, Al Ghaza

"Diplomacy, not bloodshed, is the the way to resolve the conflict in Jerusalem.  I understand that passions are high over the fate of the Holy City, but that is no excuse for what is transpiring there. This is a humanitarian crisis that must be resolved peacefully. A diplomatic solution is imperative to ensure regional stability, and I am hopeful that the forthcoming meeting between Betiutia, Solborg, and Al Ghaza will accomplish exactly that."
