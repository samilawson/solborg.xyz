Posted by: samsonia3

Nations involved: Samsonia3, European Bolsheviks, Adrea

Samsonia3's troops have been knocked off course by severe storms in the Mediterranean! The location of the troops have been lost but their last command was to head towards Andrea. Updates on the troops will come as soon as possible. The Supreme god-emperor was visibly angry when notified of the occurrence.
