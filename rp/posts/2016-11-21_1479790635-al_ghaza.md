Posted by: al_ghaza

Nations involved: NOPS, Al Ghaza, Georgekenia

Al Ghazan Secretary of Defense has just announced its membership in the military alliance, NOPS. "It is far too dangerous in this time of unrest," the Secretary stated in a public announcement. Al Ghaza promises to abide by all NOPS regulations, or face harsh sanctions. However, leaders have protested against Georgekenia's presence in the alliance. The secretary has called the nation "primitive", "untrustworthy", and even "illiterate", after reading the numerous spelling mistakes made in recent statements. Regardless, Al Ghaza hopes for the best in the future held in the alliance.
