# GEN: Concerning the War in Gothsong

Posted by: samsonia2

Nations involved: Samsonia2, Samsonia3, esteriore, Gothsong

Samsonia2 officially endorses the People's Republic of Haholand. We will provide military and monetary support if Haholand needs it. The most concerning issue of the war to us has been Samsonia3 acquiring nuclear weapons. If anyone in Haholand knows the exact location of these nukes , we demand to know immediately. The military is mobilized and ready to strike Malta if the exact location of the nukes is not disclosed.
 On another note, Samsonia2 has sent troops into the Moroccan area and begun to colonize parts of it.
