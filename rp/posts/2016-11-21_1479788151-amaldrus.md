# SPACE: Ares I Launch

Posted by: amaldrus

Nations involved: Amaldrus, Habna

I the nick of time a shuttle with 15 people aboard has launched to Mars, They left the atmosphere at 11:00pm EST or midnight Amaldrussian time.
Amaldrus and Habna can relax a bit now,
They are neutral, Habna is healing from the civil war,
And they have people right on there way to Mars with a probe ahead,
This was actually planned for later this month but all the resourced came together fairly quickly!
