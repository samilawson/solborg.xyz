Posted by: kievinki

Nations involved: Kievinki, Solborg, Raikkonia, Vladstok

Minister for Transport Kalle Stenlund said today that a new N-highway should be constructed between Pietari (St. Petersburg) and Kemi. 

"The ministry has planned that the highway starts at Pietari and then goes Salovaara-Helsinki-Turku-Pori-Vaasa-Kalajoki-Oulu and it would stop at Kemi. From there it would be continued into the rest of the Scandinavian countries."

He also said that the N2 highway will maybe be extended into Vladstok.

The expenses are unknown.
