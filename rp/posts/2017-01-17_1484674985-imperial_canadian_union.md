Nations involved: Imperial Canadian Union, New Yorkia

The PM has concluded talks with the president of New Yorkia, and is happy to say that New Yorkia will be under Canadian protection to prevent imperialistic nations from invading.

 "From henceforth, an attack on New Yorkia or her colonies will be considered as a act of war." 

In other news, tensions are at their highest between native Imperial Citizens and Slendergrad refugees are at an all-time high as some declare their support for the slenderofacist cause and others for the Gov't forces.
