Posted by: slendergrad

Nations involved: Slendergrad

Locals of a Slendergradian town named Waynesborg were outraged after a horrific crime occurred in the town. Said town, which has a population of 23,000, is known for being one of the most extreme in the nation when it comes to crimes and devotion to the state religion of Slenderism (worship of the Nexonan Emperor Slender).

An unidentified man broke into a residence in the town's wealthy Veranda Hills neighbourhood last night and stole valuables worth up to 50,000 Golden Bullets. The owner of the house allegedly had his tongue cut by the burglar in order to render him mute. His wife was also raped by the burglar before he left. Most controversial of all, he left a note denouncing Slenderism.

Activity in the town came to a pause today as the furious locals searched for the perpetrator.
