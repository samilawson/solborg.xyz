Mandalae has just announced that it will accept any and all refugees entering the country, as long as they have been properly and thoroughly vetted.

Also, in a statement made to the press, president Hagden condemned both Habna and Georgekenia for there refusal to accept any refugees. 

In a fiery statement, the president was quoted as of saying, "Small-minded governments who have their heads up their ***** are the problem here. Not the refugees who simply want a home. I hope the nations of Norrland recognized that Habna and Georgekenia's attitude towards refugees is both completely ignorant of the issues and pitifully stupid."
