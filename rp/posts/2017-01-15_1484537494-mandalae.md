# NOPS: Mandalae Announces Intentions to Rejoin NOPS

Posted by: mandalae

Nations involved: Mandalae

After a fairly lengthy removal from the Norrland Organization for Peace and Security, Joseph Hagden, President of Mandalae, has announced the nation's intentions to rejoin the alliance.

"Our country, along with other North American nations such as Esteriore, felt we were being limited in our potential when previously part of NOPS. However, after the formation of organizations like the North American League, our nation's independence has been cemented on the global stage. Much like our allies in Esteriore, we will be rejoining NOPS for a safer, more secure Norrland."

When asked to make a comment about NOPS involvement in the reactor meltdown in European Bolsheviks, President Hagden declined.
