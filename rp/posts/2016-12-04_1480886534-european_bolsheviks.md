# CHRISTMAS: European Bolsheviks decline invitation

Posted by: european_bolsheviks

Nations involved: Conaim, European Bolsheviks

The eastern European United Socialist States of European Bolsheviks have formally declined Conaim's invitation to the Christmas ceremony. The Revolutionary Worker's Council stated that the holiday as celebrated in the West merely "perpetuates capitalist rhetoric", and that the USSEB will not contribute to the "blatant exploitation of the proletariat" by attending "arbitrary gatherings of the status-quo."
