# GEN: Flu Breakout

Posted by: esteriore

Nations involved: Esteriore

A strain of the Influenza disease (The Flu) has been detected, and is spreading fast. It was first recorded this morning after a regular check-up. The disease has special properties that make it much more deadly and immune to current antibiotics.

Scientists and Physicians are preparing for the worst, as the strain has already infected over 4,000 people in a few hours. 95 people are reported to have been killed by the illness. Infected regions are currently being quarantined and travel has been banned until the breakout is contained. A state of emergency has been declared in Esteriore.

We ask for other nations in Norrland to be on the lookout for the illness, as it was only detected this morning. People may have unknowningly carried the disease to Europe and other regions under the guise of regular, more tame strain of Flu.
