# CIVIL WAR: Mandalae Sends Military Aid to Afghanipakijikistan; Cuts Ties with Habna and Georgekenia

Posted by: mandalae

Nations involved: Mandalae, Afghanipakijikistan, NOPS

Mandalae has just sent the 3rd WRA to Afghanipakijikistan to deal with the increasing violence.

Also, a carrier group (from the WRS Watson) with frigates, corvettes, and support ships has been dispatched from Mandalaean Hawaii and is heading to the Persian Gulf in order to further aid and stabilize the region.

In other news, Mandalae is officially cutting off all ties with Habna and Georgekenia due to their Islamophobic attitudes.

President Hagden's comments were so inflamatory towards the nations that he was asked to apologize by even some in Mandalae. However, he replied simply by saying, "I'll apologize when these morons remove their heads from their *****."

The president was said to have been having a bad day.
