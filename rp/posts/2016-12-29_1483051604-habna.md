Posted by: habna

Nations involved: Habna, Afghanipajikistan 

"Just a month out of a war itself, Habna would not be in a place to accept any immigrants, we have been nothing but emigrants lately" -Natata Worshnev

Afghanipajikistaninrefugees have been barred from Habna due to the nation's inability to house them however it is also evident Habna doesn't want any Muslims in the country.

"Some of the more religious orthodox Christians here are already a handful" says mayor of Hisna-anri, Habna.
Islam would be a disaster, they would kill our gays and are atheists and independent women, and our dogs! If we have any Jews over here I'am sure they would be in jeopardy too.
