# TRADE: European Economic Organization (EEO)

Posted by: firge

Nations involved: European Nations

The government of Firge has proposed the creation of the European Economic Organization (EEO) dedicated to establishing fair trade agreements between European nations, preserving the environment, and protecting workers' rights. Smaller nations who join the organization can collectively bargain for beneficial trade agreements with greater influence. All nations will benefit from access to each others' markets.

Members must apply to be part of the organization to ensure the internal market remains strong. The EEO is only open to European nations (as the name implies). All members will have an input in any decisions made. If you are interested in joining, make a post in the trade category.
