# WAR: Adrea Lands Troops, Begins Actual Invasion

Posted by: fascist_adrea

Nations involved: Adrea, Georgekenia, Nexon, Samsonia3

Adrea, only a few moments ago, has begun a spearhead assault on the northern Nile region, landing troops in the area of Alexandria all the way to Rasheed, infantry, tanks, and AFVs are piling out on the landing area in the thousands, combating any immediate resistance.

Iaerme Pales has requested that Nexon moves its troops out of the Suez region, as this is the entire reason Adrea is actually fighting Georgekenia--excluding the nukes, obviously.

Adrea has already began drawing up plans for how Georgekenia would be split up amongst combatants, the plans include cutting Alexandria in half, and giving Samsonia large control over the majority of the nation, excluding any region that Samsonia wishes to leave in Georgekenian control.
