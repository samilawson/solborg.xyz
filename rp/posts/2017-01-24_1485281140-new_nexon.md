# RELIGION: Nexon Denounced Vatican Debacle

Nations involved: New Nexon

His Imperial Majesty Emperor Slender has recently made a comment on the Vatican debacle:

"As far as I'm concerned, Madrilenos has no right whatsoever to request for the Vatican City to be relinquished to the control of the Catholic Church as it is a rightful territory of Nerisis, regardless of the manner of administration which Nerisis used to rule this territory," the Emperor commented. In another statement which sounded more controversial in the eyes of some Catholics, he said: "The Pontiff of the Church is based in Malacca City. Why don't they ask us to relinquish control over the port city as well?"

Pope Paul VII (an earlier miscommunication resulted in the Pope being called Paul I), real name Francisco Cheng, was coronated on 31 December last year as the Pope of the Nanyang Papacy by the Nexonan Emperor. Malacca City was chosen to be the headquarters as it has a significant Christian population which made up over 84% of the population. It should also be noted that almost all Nexonans believe in Slenderism, a progressive religion which venerates the Nexonan Emperor. Because of that, the crowning of their religious leader by the religious leader of another faith has been controversial in the eyes of some Catholics.
