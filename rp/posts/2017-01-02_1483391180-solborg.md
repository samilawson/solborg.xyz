Posted by: solborg

Nations involved: Solborg, Austrian Habsburgs

The Solborgian Military has intercepted and seized an unidentified ship in the Baltic Sea to the east of Gotland, Hjaartlund. The ship was spotted by an interceptor plane on a training mission and then confronted by a naval destroyer. The ship and its crew are currently being held in Ã…bo.

A large amount of Shillings from Austrian Habsburgs was found on the ship. The government suspects these were the criminals responsible for the robbery earlier today. If more substantial evidence is found, the suspects may be extradited.
