# TRADE: Samsonia2 Asks For Extra Land to Accommodate its Rapidly Growing Population

Posted by: samsonia2

Nations involved: Samsonia2, Samsonia3

The Republic of Samsonia2 Humbly asks the community of Norrland to accept our proposition to expand our nation into Morocco and Santa Cruz. This land is in Africa, raising the limit of Square Mileage allowed. Our 355 Million citizens can no longer occupy such a small area, and we humbly ask Norrland to accept our request to occupy this uninhabited land.
