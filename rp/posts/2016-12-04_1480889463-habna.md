# WOV: Habnian Violetists and WOV

Posted by: habna

Nations involved: Habna, New Telemark

Habnian Cioletists on reaction to the WOV attack in New Oslo are gathering to lobby the Habnian government to be in favor of Violetism.
They have been rallying against New Telemark saying that the Telemarkian government was ran by Habniophones and associated their errors with the fact that many of them were supposedly left handed.
Left Handed people have been targeted by local Violetists for violence.

In the face of this new conflict premier Worshnev has stated she thinks that they did not need to worry about anything as drastic as what happened in November with the workers party.
"The Violetists are small in number and can easily be stopped by our police alone.Habna's Violetist days are ancient and reverting back to them would be a major step in a bad direction"
