# WAR: Cacusia shuts down

Posted by: democratic_republic_of_cacusia

Nations involved: Cacusia, NLA, Afghanipakijikistan, Centralstan

Cacusia is decommissioning all military defense operations according to the wishes of the general public of Norrland. Cacusia is also shutting all government and non government operations down. Borders are open for those wishing to leave but not those wishing to enter. Film cameras are being set up so that the world can watch the death of millions of Cacusians. Alfapenguice will remain in the capitol waiting for invasion. He/she is locked in the city with an organ and the score to The Phantom of the Opera. No resistance will be given and if any enimy forces reach the capitol, Alfapenguice will be killed. It should be remembered that when Cacusia was peaceful it was invaded three times and threatened on many occasions. Cacusia was one of the two nations who advocated for peace in the Troiyan conflict, and was not listened to and was ridiculed because it was peaceful. Now when Cacusia retaliates against violence it is still ridiculed. The people of Cacusia who are dying request that Norrland make up its mind before Cacusia ceases existence.
