Nations involved: European Bolsheviks

In preparation for the annual labor lottery on January first, 2017, the Department for Festivities has announced that it will be hosting a 30 day celebration. Its goal is to praise the party for its successes over the past year and to remember the revolutionary heroes that fell whilst the defending the valiant People’s Republic. 

The Commemoration will include a large-scale propaganda campaign intended to strengthen national unity and scrutinize other Nations. Posters often depict the Fascist Iaerme Pales in a bed with Samsonia3, both hiding under a blanket in fear of European Bolshevik might. 

Loud speakers in the streets often feature national icons such as Nikolai Babachoff and Olga Petrogradia denouncing the criminal NOPS, and the speakers also play musical masterpieces from the Revolution during work hours in Industrial districts. 

All Workers are still expected to follow their regular schedules and tend to their duties until January first. The Revolutionary Worker’s Council has predicted that by the end of the year, economic output will have increased threefold from last year’s figures.
