# WAR: Georgekenia reclarifies and makes moves

Posted by: georgekenia

Nations involved: Georgekenia

In American English;

Georgekenia will not go to war with any country right now,
and Georgekenia has never had any taxes on people moving through the Suez Canal, which Geogekenia shares with Betiutia, so Geogekenia would not be able to establish a tax anyway.

Geogekenia will also join Samsonia's allaince In order to stop this unfair war.
