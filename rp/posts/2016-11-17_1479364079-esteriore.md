Nations involved: WSCN, NO

The Esterian government would like to reassure Mandalae and other nations worried about having 2 alliances at the same time. The WSCN was created to offer more choices to nations in Norrland. They can choose a more economically oriented military alliance or a more military-focused alliance. We encourage nations to take the route that better suites them.

In other news, the Esterian government is fully prepared to deal with its own affairs, and will require no more foreign aid. It has also come to light that Esneria will be joining the WSCN.
