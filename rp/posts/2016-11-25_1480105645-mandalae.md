# SPACE: Mandalaean Astronauts Arrive on Enceladus

Posted by: mandalae

Nations involved: Mandalae

Mandalaean astronauts have safely arrived on Enceladus, one of Saturn's largest moons. The astronauts will set up an outpost with the various materials supplied to them on their ship before going into cryo-sleep.

This outpost is the precursor to a planned Mandalaean colony on Enceladus, with upwards of 2,000 colonists by 2019.

The astronauts will be awakened in 3 months, when the next batch of colonists arrive. Once there, the work of building more living spaces will begin.
