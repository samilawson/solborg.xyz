Posted by: slendergrad

Nations involved: Slendergrad

The Slendergradian military police cracked down on a protest in Slendergrad City, which was attended by over 45,000, resulting in the deaths of 87 and 436 injuries.

The protest was started by the Slenderofascist Party, a radical political party of the Slenderian religion which almost all Nexonans believe in, in light of the government's failure to crack down on anti-Slenderian societies after one committed a horrendous crime against a Slenderian. This resulted in the people living in radicalised parts of the country taking action by beheading or lynching suspected anti-Slenderians. As the protesters threatened to overthrow the government, the military police reacted by firing rubber bullets and tear gas canisters at them.

Some of the protesters fought back with homemade guns and machetes, forcing the military police to call for reinforcements. They responded by shooting at the protesters with actual bullets, killing 80 protesters and injuring hundreds. The protesters dispersed within 35 minutes after the reinforcements arrived.

Martial law has currently been declared throughout the entire country by President Anthony Lee. However, it was expected that the religious fanatics would not let this matter slip easily. Experts have predicted that the country is on the verge of a bloodbath.
