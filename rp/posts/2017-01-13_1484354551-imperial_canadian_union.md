Nations involved: Imperial Canadian Union, Slendergrad, Mandalae

After the devastating siege of Waynesborg, with it's cataclysmic end, the Emperor has made a call to action for any available Nation in Norrland to protect the peace, and to assure freedom, stability and safety to any and all who seek it in the form of a demilitarized safe zone operated by a committee of neutral Nations. The Imperial Canadian Unionist Prime minister has already affirmed the support of the ICU and Mandalae as mediators and non-partisan nations. A "free zone" will be created as to help refugees and keep the peace. "The call is being heard as we speak" the PM said today in a press release.
