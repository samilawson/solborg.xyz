# TERROR: Slenderofascist Leader Perished in Car Bombing

Posted by: slendergrad

Nations involved: Slendergrad, United Texico

The Slenderofascist Party general secretary John Low, who fled the country on a commercial flight after the Slenderofascist uprising failed, met a violent end to his life this morning as he drove a rented car across the streets of Georgetown, Nanyang. The car was about to enter a T-junction when it apparently exploded. While it was initially thought to be a car bomb, surveillance footage later showed what seemed to be a small UAV, perhaps filled with explosives, ramming itself into the vehicle, causing an explosion which injured several other bystanders.

Because of the unusual method of assassination, it was suspected that the Slendergradian government was responsible for the killing. It also resulted in the Slendergradian government being listed as the suspected mastermind of several other recent killings around the world targeting exiled Slenderofascists as well.
