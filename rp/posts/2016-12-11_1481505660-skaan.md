# INTERNATIONAL: Xenophobic, belligerent Grand Duchy receives President of Mandalae with... 'open' arms!?

Posted by: skaan

Nations involved: The Western Republic of Mandalae, The Grand Duchy of Skaan

The somewhat more cultured President Joseph Hagden of Mandalae looked less than impressed being drawn along the streets of the so called 'Grand Duchy' of Skaan in his Goat led Chariot of state, today. 

As the procession made it's way from the airport towards the Ducal Palace, his excellency the President only trailing a few miles behind the Duke's entourage, this reporter could not help but notice the less than enthusiastic welcome to this nation's ally.

As conflict with Skaan's southern neighbors continue to plague the nation it was only a question of time before the Grand Duke reached out to his more liberal westerly neighbors in a bid for friendship.

It remains to be seen if this somewhat lackluster start is merely the legacy of an isolationist, post soviet reactionary state or merely the reservations of a newly liberated nation...taking its first tentative steps on the international walkway.
