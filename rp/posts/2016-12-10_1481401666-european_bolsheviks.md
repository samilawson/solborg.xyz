Nations involved: European Bolsheviks, Fascist Adrea

In response to Iaerme Pales' excessive reaction to the propaganda campaign in the People's Republic, the Revolutionary Worker's Council has announced that it will reciprocate the actions... by purging the population. 

Any European Bolshevik in possession of a leaflet dropped by Adrean planes will be executed by S.P.P.R.E.B agents. Furthermore, any political opponents to the European Bolshevik party will be "cleansed" by members of the CRM (Cultural Revolutionary Movement). 

Since the announcement by the Revolutionary Worker's Council, 60,000 "traitors" have already been "arrested" within the Capital and other cities. 

The Ministry of Construction has announced that it will be constructing a large wall along the border with Fascist Adrea. 300,000 troops will be stationed along the Militarized zone to defend the border from Adrean aggression.
