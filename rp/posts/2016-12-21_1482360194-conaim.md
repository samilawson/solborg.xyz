# MORMON WAR: Salt Lake Bloodbath

Posted by: conaim

Nations involved: Conaim, Utah, Vladimirstan

Very close to the Vladimirstan border (not according to Mormons) A large battle has taken place on the shore of the Great Salt Lake, 4,300 Conaimese regulars have died and 5,600 Sons of Utah are dead, each side wants to win the war before Christmas. So far Conaim is keeping its ground and making some advancements but the radical Mormon state is not close to breaking.
