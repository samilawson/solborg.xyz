# GEN: Law Enforcement Discovers Source of Rebel Weapons

Posted by: al_ghaza

Nations involved: al ghaza, warriors of violet

Investigators have confirmed that the weapons used in the government building attack earlier were indeed from an outside source. The weapons were sent from The Warriors of Violet, a terrorist group that has long opposed the current government system in Al Ghaza, claiming it is not the ideal caliphate God has given them. Grenade launchers and assault rifles were provided to the rebel army, allowing them to successfully ambush the Government Building in Tehran. While it is not clear where Violetist forces are exactly located, investigators have traced their location to unclaimed territory East of Tehran. 

The WOV's involvement in the war will be a key factor for the resistance fighters to succeed, but with involvement from such a group, there is surely going to be backlash among the international community in Norrland.
