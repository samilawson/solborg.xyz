Posted by: samsonia3

Nations involved: Samsonia3, Georgekenia, European Bolsheviks, Facist Adrea

Samsonia3 has accepted Georgekenia's surrender terms. Welcome to the LRN! 

All of Samsonia3's troops (and their still-unnamed helper) will be moved via aircraft carrier into Adrea to fight the Bolsheviks, and then when they (inevitably) crush the Bolsheviks, they will venture into their country. Samsonia2's Soldier Count is upwards of 200,000, along with planes and tanks, and their unnamed ally has 175,000 troops.
