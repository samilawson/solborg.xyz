Nations involved: Kievinki, Afghanipakijikistan

“I say very clearly that I see no possibility at this time of refugees coming to Kievinki,” Prime Minister Ilmari Tolonen said on Friday.

That’s a decision that has strong support.

A new opinion poll found that 86 percent of Kievinkians want the country’s borders closed to refugees.

“We will not take people who believe in a religion supporting crime, terrorism, homophobia and anti-Semitism that sets synagogues ablaze,” he said, according to Salovaaran Uutiset. “There will be no outlaw districts, no riots and no gangs hunting for our wives and daughters.”
