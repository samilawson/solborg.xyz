# TRADE: Samsonia3 and Slendergrad Reach another Trade Agreement!

Posted by: samsonia3

Nations involved: Slendergrad, Samsonia3

Slendergrad and Samsonia3 have come to an agreement! In exchange for chemical weapons, which Samsonia3 will research in their labs and attempt to find antidotes for, as well as small arms for military use. Some of these small arms will be used by our infrantry, but some will also be used to reserach improving Slendergrad's (and Samsonia's) weapons. Finally, Slendergrad will also give Samsonia3 access to their Tanks/AFV's and their Air Force! Those troops will still be stationed in Slendergrad, though. In return, Samsonia3 promises military assistance to Slendergrad in any time of need! 

"This is a great day in Samsonia3's (and Slendergrad's) history! To commemorate it, we will also begin to construct a massive Airport with direct flights to Slendergrad, as well as other armies!" 

More to come on the airport soon.
