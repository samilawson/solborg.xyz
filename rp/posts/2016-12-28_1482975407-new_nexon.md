Posted by: new_nexon

Nations involved: New Nexon, Sons of Utah (unrecognised), Hiachijan 

Preparations for the wedding have apparently not deterred the diligent Nexonan Emperor Slender as he ordered a series of missile strikes which finally destroyed the remaining Sons of Utah. It was later confirmed by others that the Sons of Utah are finally wiped off from the face of Norrland.

"My duties as the Supreme Commander of the Nexonan military still have to be carried out despite the fact that I'm occupied by private affairs at the moment. With the terrorists finally wiped off, I hope that world leaders can finally pass this year in relief and those attending my wedding with Empress Aulmerri will have a good time there," the Emperor announced in a speech.
