# JRS: Georgekenia's Nukes

Posted by: solborg

Nations involved: Georgekenia, Solborg, Ellenstedt

Solborgian and Ellenstedtian intelligence services, who have been collaborating and have extensive information on certain high-threat nations' weapons capabilities, have called out Georgekenia on their bluff. The nation does not have a "few hundred nukes," but instead three prototypes of a model which failed to detonate properly when tested. It also does not have the technology to place them on missiles.
