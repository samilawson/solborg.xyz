# GEN: Influx of Troops Pushes Samsonia3 back for the time being

Posted by: samsonia2

Nations involved: Samsonia2, Stockgrove, Ellenstedt, Odenreig, Kievinki, Gullandia, New Woking, Samsonia3, Portmany Arms Base 

The influx of troops from Esteriore, Al Ghaza, and Solborg/NOPS has kept Samsonia3 from taking Ibiza. Now reinforcements can come much more freely. 
We hope this atrocious event ends soon enough. For the safety of all nations.
