Nations involved: Imperial Canadian Union, New-Nexon

After long deliberation, the two emperors, Emperor Maxim and Emperor Slender, have agreed upon a mutually beneficial trade agreement. The new railroad will pass from the Nexon Administrative territory to the port of Churchill, using parts of the existing Trans-Continental railway. The project is being paid for by a joint commission, and will be done within the year. It is forecasted that the project will pay for its self within the decade, running extensive trade to and from the port of Churchill.
