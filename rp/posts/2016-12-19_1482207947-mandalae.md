Nations involved: Mandalae, Esteriore, Fascist Adrea

Due to the recent victory of Mandalaean, Esterian, and Adrean troops in the war against the European Bolsheviks, Mandalae has invited the leaders of Adrea and Esteriore to celebrate at the capital, Santandem.

Mere hours after Mandalae joined the fight, the Bolsheviks accepted Adrea's terms for peace. In light of this exciting new development, the Mandalaean government felt it necessary to extend an offer of friendship and gratitude towards both Adrea and Esteriore by inviting their leaders to stay in Santandem and celebrate.
