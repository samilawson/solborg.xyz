# GEN: Esteriore prepares for Hurricane Isaaca

Posted by: esteriore

Nations involved: Esteriore

After hearing the recent news that a Hurricane was on course to hit Esteriore, preparations are being made for the winds and rain that will come.

Southern Esteriore is the main region being evacuated, as it is expected that the storm will dissipate near Newfoundland. A weather research team will be sent to investigate the hurricane and predict how strong the winds will be when it reaches our nation. The Esterian government is also offering aid to Hiachijan, as the storm is expected to first hit there.
