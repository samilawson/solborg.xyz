Nations involved: Afghanipakijikistan

Last night, a group of Violetist sympathizers seized a government building in Herat. Police on the scene have reported that 8 people were killed on Abdul-Aziz road as the attackers stormed the local government office. 

An hour after the event unfolded, the terrorists announced via megaphone that they have 5 officials in captivity.

The local amateur police force has been unable to facilitate a response to the situation. According to insider information, 20 officers left their post just last week, a trend which has become a commonality in the cities of Herat, Ghourian, Anar Dara, and Farah over the past months. 

Sheikh Muhammad Ameen has released a statement in which he supports the actions, saying that the current Sultan Ahmed Abdullah Abu al-Fawaris has been “neglecting his duties and raping the country’s future.”

The prominent Sheikh’s irreverence towards the 400 year-old Afghanipakijikistani Sultanate has caused significant disputes between the royalist majority and the extremist minority in the country for several years. It remains to be seen whether or not the tensions will escalate into a conflict as a result of this recent occurrence.

The Sultan is still hiding in his palace in Kabul. The royal goat-count is up to 54, whilst the wife-count has dropped by 7 points on the “chastity scale” to an all-time low of 20.
