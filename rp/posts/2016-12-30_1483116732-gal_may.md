The Commonwealth is thrilled to see other nations supporting her interests in the international community. Though (citing recent Statements from Habna and Georgekenia) The Commonwealth calls out to the nations of Norrland that have already revoked all support of the rogue states of Habna and Georgekenia, to also impose diplomatic and economic sanctions upon them.

The Ministry of Foreign Relations asks the nations of Mandalae and New Nexon to officially denounce, and issue embargos against Georgekenia and Habna.
