# JRS: Solborg Calls For Diplomatic Solution

Posted by: solborg

Nations involved: Solborg, Betiutia, Al Ghaza

The Prime Minister of Solborg is calling for a meeting to be held with representatives from Al Ghaza and Betiutia on 23 November in Tammerfors to discuss a diplomatic solution to the current conflict. The Chancellor of Ellenstedt will also be attending. Small groups of protesters have met outside of the Betiutian and Ghazan embassies. One man, a Ghazan citizen, was arrested for assaulting a guard outside the Betiutian embassy by throwing eggs at him.

NOPS Secretary General Jans Ã…kesson has not yet commented on the situation since banning Betiutia. It is unlikely for NOPS to get involved in this conflict militarily, although the possibility still remains if there is any action taken against Vladimirstan's Sunni Crescent, which borders Betiutia to the south.
