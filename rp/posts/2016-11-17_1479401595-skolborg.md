# TRADE: Ministry of Economy facilitates business for WSCN nations

Posted by: skolborg

Nations involved: WSCN

In a report published by the Ministry of Economy and Finance, it was announced that WSCN members and companies originated form these nations would benefit from privileges on the Skolburger market. These are:

- An interest rate when borrowing in Skolborg of 0%. The Ministry will reimburse commercial banks that do so. 

- A suppression of tariffs and other trade barriers on Skolburger borders, ports and airports. 

- An optimised fiscal situation for WSCN companies when dealing in Skolborg, nearly equal to Skolburger companies.

- A slash in airport and portuary tax for WSCN airlines, sealines and cargo, all repaid by government. 

- Optimised price of highway vignettas. 

The Ministry reminded companies doing business in Skolborg must follow Skolburger law. It also expressed its hopes for similar measures to be taken in other WSCN countries, to avoid unloyal competition.
