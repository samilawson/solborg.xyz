Nations involved: The Kolam Brotherhood, EHSP, Possibly the rest of Norrland

Greetings from The Kolam Brotherhood,

Firstly, The Kolam Brotherhood is proud to announce that it will be partnering with the EHSP in astronomical research and biosuit engineering. The head of the Kolami Astronomical Committee recently stated, "We are very thrilled that we are helping out other nations and making a difference in our world, and possibly, the cosmos." 

Secondly, the Secondary of the Kolam Brotherhood, Alyssa Adams, has resigned. Usually, the backup Secondary would take the original's place, but the Prime Minister quickly ejected him too. Right now is a dangerous time for the Kolam Brotherhood, as if the current leader passed away, no legal successor would be in place, thus leading to the possibility of a civil war.

Lastly, The Kolam Brotherhood announced its neutrality, and asked that other neutral nations band together to avoid getting killed. The Kolam Brotherhood proposed the A.N.N., the Alliance of Neutral Nations. The Kolam Brotherhood proposed this to ensure the safety of the nations who do not obligated themselves towards major conflicts. The alliance will stay neutral towards everything ( unless majority rules otherwise), and is open to all nations. For more information, please telegram The Kolam Brotherhood.
