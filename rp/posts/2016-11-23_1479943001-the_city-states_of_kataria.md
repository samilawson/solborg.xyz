At 5:09 PM today, 23-11-16, A Katari Satellite redirected from the skies over Odenreig collided with the Esnerian(3) satellite containing an unknown bio-weapon. The two satellites were demolished and burned up over Morocco. What is left of the Bio-weapon is believed to have fallen over Almeria, Samsonia3, the Mediterranean Sea, and possibly the western reaches of Num Haholand. Kataria has also completed its missile defense system in the last week. It is now capable of protecting the whole country.
