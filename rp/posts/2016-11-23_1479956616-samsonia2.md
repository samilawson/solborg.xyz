Posted by: samsonia2

Nations involved: Samsonia2, Stockgrove, Ellenstedt, Odenreig, Kievinki, Gullandia, New Woking, Samsonia3, Portmany Arms Base 

Samsonia2 has identified the bioweapon to be anthrax. Unfortunately, the fatality rate will be as high as 75-85%. All troops have been moved to Pujols until more reinforcements come and the men are treated. The Tanks and planes sent stand guard at the island.

Also, Samsonia2 thanks Kataria for downing the satellite, and has set up a colonial government in Morocco. This government answers to Samsonia2. The colony will be called "The Freest Men". The government's first task will be to set up emergency health centers for those in Morocco infected by the anthrax spread by the downed satellite.
