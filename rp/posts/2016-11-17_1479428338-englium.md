# NMC: Proposal of The Great North American Triple Ringroad

Posted by: englium

Nations involved: Englium, New Woking, Esteriore, Carrodon, Skolborg

The government of Englium is proposing to build multiple motorways in eastern America. They would be based around the Great Lakes and would connect some of the biggest urban areas in the continent. 

Antti Sinkermans, the Minister of Transport and Communication, has stated that after all the tension and violent events in the region, "a big and cooperative project involving several nations, such as this one, is definitely something that we need". He hopes that it will help bring in some peace and unity, and encourages all of the involved nations to agree to participate - "perhaps we can build one ring road or even two, but for the project to be fully complete, it is essential that all nations contribute". 

All nations willing to participate must contact the Government of Englium.
