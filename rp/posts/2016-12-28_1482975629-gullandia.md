Posted by: gullandia

Nations involved: Gullandia, Hiachijan, New Nexon

Gullandia's Supreme Chief Viktor Tiqriganianning IXX announced that he, along with his wife Sue Tiqriganianning, will be attending the wedding of Empress Aulmerri of Hiachijan and Emperor Slender of New Nexon on December 29th in Khyren.

In a recent interview with GNN, Mr. Tiqriganianning stated that, "I am overjoyed at this union! This is truly one of the greatest moments in Norrlandic history! I simply cannot wait to attend!"

The slightly more sensible Grand Council Asbj√∏rn Rasmussen also commented saying, "I wish Empress Aulmerri and Emperor Slender the best. While I regretfully am unable to attend, I hope the Tiqriganiannings' attendance will improve relations with Hiachijan and suffice as a greeting to New Nexon who we have, up until this point, neglected to contact in any matter."

Rasmussen is unable to attend due to his preparations for the upcoming Grand Council Race starting New Year's Day and ending January 31st. The winner will be announced February 1st.
