# BIO: Hiachijan Begins Researching a Vaccine

Posted by: hiachijan

Nations involved: Hiachijan, Esteriore, North American nations

In light of the outbreak of the Esterian Flu, Hiachijan has temporarily closed its airports and has halted any existing trade routes between North American nations until further notice.

Any Hiachijanese living in mainland North America WILL be allowed to return, but upon arrival they will be placed under highly strict quarantine, and are to remain deep in a bunker dedicated to scenarios like this, beneath Khyren, until a vaccine is possible. Patients are to be taken good care of, but they will be completely isolated from other Hiachijanese (with the exception of check-ups and such).

Hiachijan will also be researching a vaccine as well. We have contacted various other nations performing research efforts, such as Vreekomfdod, to cooperate and share our research progress.
