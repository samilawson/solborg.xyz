The Government of The federal republic of Baverland started a new education program. ANY new student from ANY ethnical minority have to undergo a "Minority Integration Program" or "MIP". which is divided into three stages. First stage is lasting from 6 months to 1 year, and its purpose is to teach the student the official language to at least reasonable level. Second stage is fairly short, ranging from few days to a month, and its supposed to teach the student about the Traditions and customs of the national majority. and the third stage is putting them to schools, and observing how they do in the society of (mostly) eaqually aged children and students of the Baverland nationality. The results have been so far, more than promising.
