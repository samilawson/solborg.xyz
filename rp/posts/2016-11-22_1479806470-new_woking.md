Nations involved: New Woking

Today marked an important day for the New Woking's democratic state. The citizens took part in a referendum regarding whether or not the nation should look into producing Nuclear Warheads for the use of protection.

Earlier today, the defense minister spoke out. "Of course we'd like to be able to start production, you see other nations like Samsonia3 and Habna who have nukes, and you think: "What chance do we have?"". He continues. "Obviously we know the right decision here, but we're relying on our people to make the right choice."

Polls closed at 11:59 GMT on 21 November 2016, with a turnout of 86%. The results are below:

PRODUCE WARHEADS: 28.7%

DO NOT PRODUCE WARHEADS 71.3%
