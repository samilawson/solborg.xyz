Posted by: fascist_athena

Nations involved: Fascist Athena, Fascist Adrea

The Fascist Athenian Leader Alexander Pagonis recently announced the commencement of his five-year plan, which is meant to restore Athena's crumbling economy.

His first objective is to unify Fascist Athena with its Northern neighbor Fascist Adrea by constructing a Trans-Balkan railway connecting the two nations' major cities.

The railway would link the following cities in order:

-Athens
-Thessaloniki
-Sofia
-Belgrade
-Zagreb

The Leader Alexander Pagonis hopes to speak with Iaerme Pales herself, long may she live, in order to discuss the potential establishment of this promising concept.
