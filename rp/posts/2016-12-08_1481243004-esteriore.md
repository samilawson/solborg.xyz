Posted by: esteriore

Nations involved: Esteriore

An Esterian Aircraft carrier (one of 13) has just been hijacked by a gang of pirates! 3 Hours ago, an announcement was made in the carrier saying the ship was due for maintenance (A fake message forged by the pirates). The entire crew left the ship unguarded and wandered off, while the criminals loaded the ship with 200-300 tons of drugs and illegal weapons. 

The ship is suspected to making its way to Europe, but the specified location is unknown. Search teams are currently scouting the Northern Atlantic ocean looking for the ship. If any info is known on the whereabouts of the carrier, please contact us immediately.
