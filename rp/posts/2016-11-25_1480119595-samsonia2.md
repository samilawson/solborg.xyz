Samsonia2's SamsonXIV has opted to meet with the Supreme God-Emperor in Madagascar to negotiate the treaty. Any other nations that are willing to participate should come immediately. This is a tipping point in the escalating conflict between the two nations. If a deal is reached, then things could get better. If one is not, things will most certainly be worse.
