# ECO: Hurricane Isaaca Delivers Minimal Damage

Posted by: hiachijan

Nations involved: Hiachijan, Esteriore

Hurricane Isaaca, currently a Category 2 hurricane (and expected to strengthen), has made landfall in Hiachijan at 7:34 PM Default Hiachijan Time.

Because the Hiachijanese are ethnically paranoid, architecture is designed to withstand the forces of hurricanes, earthquakes and potential tsunamis, considering how many times in the past they have experienced them.

While not completely immune to the damages that may be caused, these national reinforcements have minimalized any damage brought by Isaaca, and it is expected to continue that way for the duration of the storm. No fatalities have occurred as of now.

Hiachijan has declined the Esterian government's assistance. Instead, they are willing to help Esteriore if they require the aid.
