# GEN: Samsonia3 Denounces Esteriore's rash actions

Posted by: samsonia3

Nations involved: Samsonia3, esteriore,

Samsonia2 Denounces Esteriore's kicking our nation out of the WSCN. We have been trying our best to improve the international community, and securing nuclear weapons is an issue that only we can deal with. That being said, we offered Esteriore a compromise, only to see that they had already kicked out our nation from the allegiance. 2 hours is nowhere near enough time to reasonably expect a response. Samsonia3 will now mull its options on what Alliance to join and what actions to take concerning Samsonia2 (who has occupied land that rightly belongs to us) and Esteriore.
