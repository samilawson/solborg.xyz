# WAR: Conaim urges Vladimirstan to defend its Section of Utah from the radicals

Posted by: conaim

Nations involved: Conaim, Utah, Esteriore, Mandalae, Vladimirstan

Raids from foreign countries have prevented Utah from advancing.
The Sons of Utah however, has not had a dent I. It's supplies.
Intel believes the supplies are coming from the Vladmiristani portion of Utah, which Vladmiristan has not declared war on despite that they are no longer paying their taxes and identify with the state of Utah.
Vladimirstan must take action or the only way to stop the radical Mormons would be to operate in their territory.
