# GE: Adrean Loudspeakers on Overdrive

Posted by: fascist_adrea

Nations involved: Fascist Adrea, European Bolsheviks

As construction on the wall between the Bolshevik and Adrean borders begins, the speaker systems along the Adrean border are upgraded in retaliation, forcing all construction workers to listen to the pure glory and greatness of the Adrean people. Soldiers patrol the border non-stop, forming their own proto-wall with their bodies, as they walk from speaker to speaker, yelling obscenities at any Bolsheviks between broadcasts, the only periods of time where they are not wearing sound-proof ear wear.

Iaerme Pales has denounced the Bolshevik administration for alleged crimes against humanity and destroying free speech in their nation. She has been seen travelling between Firz, where she communicates with the Senate, and the border, leading patrols with the most elite of her army.
