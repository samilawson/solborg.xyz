# SPACE: Fiamma I lands on the Moon!

Posted by: esteriore

Nations involved: Esteriore

The Fiamma I rocket has just landed on the moon and Esteriore has won the race to the moon! An Esterian flag will be planted into the moon dust for all future visitors to see.

Several experiments will be conducted on the moon (Most of them are related to Zero-G and Moon Rock) over the course of two days, and the ship will return after that. All discoveries will be shared among nations.
