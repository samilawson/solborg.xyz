Just hours after the dust had settled, soldiers in the Portmany area are coming down with serious symptoms. So far, most of them are vomiting, experiencing headaches, and are running fevers. One report, not yet verified, has said that the worst-off soldiers have begun to cough up blood and have bloody diarrhea. Again, this is not confirmed yet.
We reasonably deduct that these symptoms are being caused by the dust, but some of the lower-ranking soldiers are coming down with the symptoms too, begging a question as to why Samsonia3 would harm their own men.
