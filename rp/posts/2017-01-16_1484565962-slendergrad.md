# INTERNAL: Constitution, Interim Government

Posted by: slendergrad

Nations involved: Slendergrad

Several provisions of the new Constitution of Slendergrad have been revealed to the public. The Constitution, allegedly completely written by President Archer Lee, stipulated that political parties can still be created. However, they will have to partake in a coalition led by the ruling National Development Party or be outlawed. In addition, the President is also given the powers to dissolve the Parliament at will and to appoint Members of Parliament as well. The Parliament is now mostly reduced to a consultative role and rubber stamp legislature which adopts the President's decrees.

Besides that, a new interim government led by Prime Minister Sabina Crane (who was rumoured to have gained the position because she's a lover of the President) has been put in place by the President. It is expected to stay in charge even after the Constitution has been created.
