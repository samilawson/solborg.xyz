Posted by: new_woking

Nations involved: New Woking, Esteriore

After a previous government official of Esteriore was found in hiding, New Woking has made the decision to close its' borders. No flights will be going in or out of the country, and strict police forces will be assigned to the northen border of the country.

"This is a massive threat to the security and safety of this nation." Prime Minister Paige Bance spoke out on the issue. "The threat of there being government officials hiding in our country will cause Esterians to be outraged. The last things that we need is hatred towards our neighbours." 

It was 48 hours ago that the government stated that all Esterians must leave the country, which now means that any residents that are still present in the country will be placed under political imprisonment until they are extracted by Esteriore.

Estimated population 17-11-2016: 26,800,000 (1,500 Esterians -99.625%)
