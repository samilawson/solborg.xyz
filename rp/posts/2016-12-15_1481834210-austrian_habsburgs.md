Posted by: austrian_habsburgs

Nations involved: Austrian Habsburgs, Raikkonia

This morning, Minister of Interior Heinz St√§nder praised the Federation of Raikkonia for its benevolent aid program.

The Republic of Austrian Habsburgs has always emphasized the importance of maintaining international stability and World peace. Therefore, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has announced that it will be funding an Austrian Habsburg aid program similar to Raikkonia's.

In his speech to the Parliament, Foreign Minister Martin Oberhauser urged foreign governments to "establish their own aid-relief programs and cooperate with other nations in order to facilitate a speedy response to any event around the world which may require foreign-aid."
