# NUKE: Comment on Georgekenian nukes

Posted by: esteriore

Nations involved: Esteriore, Georgekenia

Esteriore has just taken action after hearing about the news that Georgekenia has begun developping nuclear weapons. Sanctions will be put on Georgekenia limiting the importing of Esterian goods, especially minerals and weapons, and a total and complete travel ban on Tourism to and from the country.

Spies may be sent to southern Georgekenian territory to locate the test sites of these nuclear weapons, and inform other nations of recent advancements made by the country.

We highly encourage other nations to follow suite and pose sanctions to limit Georgekenia's program.
