Posted by: hispatia

Nations involved: Hispatia

In a mind blowing victory, the Welfare Partido has won the presidency last minute by only a thousand votes. The new Presidente-Especial of the Hispatian nation, P.E. Rodrigo Peridido, will be briefed on the events occurring in the nation, the economy, military, and important matters before taking office next week. His Vice President, the Refresco Partido Candidate, Jeronimo Kevin de Panama, will be taking his position today. The change in power from the previous Refresco/Verde administration is very peaceful, and the previous P.E., Ximeno Juarez, has congratulated Peridido.
