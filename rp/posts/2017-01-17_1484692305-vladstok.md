Posted by: vladstok

Nations involved: Vladstok, NOPS, Troiya

With Vladstok's neighbors now embroiled in a potentially bloody war, and Vladstok's history of disarmament, the issue of helping the war effort was addressed today by the prime minister.

"Vladstok, I stand before you today with the ominous warning of war on our borders. The Troiyan menace to our south is threatening the very stability of this region, and the safety of everyone in it. With our friends in the NOPS at war with Troiya, we as Vladstokians need to do our part. To accomplish this, we will be using radio and TV broadcasts, as well as attempting to infiltrate their computer networks to show the Troiyans that their government is a deadly threat to all societies and peoples, including their own. We may not have a military, but we do have defense, and if need be, an offense. Look in fear, Troiya, because we are coming, and no soldier can stop the barrage of bullets that a cannon of information brings."

This stirring speech by Olgya Estern is sure to excite the populous and intimidate the Troiyans. Time will tell if this works.
