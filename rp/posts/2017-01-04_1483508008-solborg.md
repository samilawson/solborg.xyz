# SPACE: Satellites Purchased By Government

Posted by: solborg

Nations involved: solborg

The government of Solborg has recently purchased three imaging satellites from the internationally popular search engine Kunskap, which also provides a mapping service, for a total of 86,000 Solborgian Kronor or 162,000 International Dollars. The satellites were being decommissioned by Kunskap in favor of a series of newer satellites to take clearer photos.

The government announced that the satellites will be used for security and research purposes. In order to ensure transparency, all uses of the satellites will be logged and published to be available to the general public. This is part of a series of security-related spending increases that the government has enacted in the recent months before the national elections, which will occur on the 14th and 15th of January.

Kunskap, a Solborgian company that was founded in 1998, is the most popular search provider in a number of modern nations. It currently employs 54,209 people worldwide since its 2015 acquisition of Telemarkian smartphone and battery manufacturer Lillehammer. Kunskap has long been known for its friendly relations with the Solborgian government, having received numerous research grants in the past and enjoying relatively few restrictions with regard to publishable information and personal security.
