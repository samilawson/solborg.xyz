Posted by: fascist_adrea

Nations involved: Fascist Adrea, Estoire

As per the request made by the Estoire government, Adrea has announced it's support for the Federal candidate in Estoire. Iaerme Pales, before leaving for the border once more, said that "socialists tend to be a national problem, something that should be avoided is a socialist take over."

While she does confirm that she believes in many liberal ideas, she denies that democracy nor socialism have ever benefited any one nation or citizen.

"Estoire shouldn't be having this issue," she continued, "Carver was a good leader. Good leaders shouldn't be removed by the people because 'it's just time for a new one'. If they aren't broke, don't fix it."
