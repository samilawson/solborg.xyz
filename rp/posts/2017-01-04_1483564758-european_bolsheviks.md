# ENERGY: European Bolsheviks allow Inspections

Posted by: european_bolsheviks

Nations involved: European Bolsheviks, LRN, NOPS

The Glorious Immortal Dear Leader has stated that he will permit inspectors from NOPS member nations to monitor the usage of Nuclear Power Plants in the People's Republic, only if Samsonia3 and Fascist Adrea cease to invade European Bolshevik Air Space. 

"We guarantee transparency and military demobilization, if the LRN stops its criminal and aggressive actions above our proletarian cities and fields", said Vice-Chairman of the Revolutionary Army Lao Chi at a spontaneous party conference.  

This decision by the Glorious Immortal Dear Leader once more proves that the People's Republic will cooperate with its Global Comrades, in order to diplomatically combat the corrupt Fascist menace embodied by the paranoid dictatorship of the Samsonias and their leeches.
