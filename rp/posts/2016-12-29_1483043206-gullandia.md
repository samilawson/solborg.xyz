# GEN: New Homestead-Ready Land Claimed in Central North America

Posted by: gullandia

Nations involved: Gullandia, New Telemark, North American Nations in General

Following requests from citizens to expand Gullandian territory, Grand Council Asbj√∏rn Rasmussen has signed a deal with New Telemark. This deal will allow Gullandian citizens to pass through New Telemark on their way to the newly claimed "Enkland."

 A small amount of military personnel (7500 troops) will also be settled into Enkland to act as a police force until proper settlements are made. As Rasmussen stated in a recent interview, the primary purpose of Enkland is to "preserve the beauty of this land and protect it from nations who's ideals threaten to destroy it. Half of the land will be dedicated to preserving Enkland's natural wonder while the other half will be reserved for settlments."
