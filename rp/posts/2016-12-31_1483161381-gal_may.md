# TERROR: Unprecedented veto revocation.

Nations involved: Gal may

The recently Passed "Internal-Defense Act" set an unprecedented revocation of a veto from the Ministry of Foreign Relations.

The Bill has not only strengthened the Ministry of Intelligence, but significantly shifted state power from the Ministry of Foreign Relations in favor of the security agency.

This law, though most astonishing for its manner of implementation, may forge a difficult path for nations opposing the will of The Commonwealth.
