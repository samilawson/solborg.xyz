# GEN: Kolami Colony Uprising Frightens Officials

Posted by: the_kolam_brotherhood

Nations involved: The Kolam Brotherhood, my puppets Anglynd and Syltar, 

The Kolami Colony of Syltar is now seen as a threat to Kolam as the colony seems to be disloyal to the current government. Syltar is a small colony in Australia with a leader appointed by the Prime Minister. While the Syltaean military is small, The Kolam Brotherhood could loose control their various islands or Anglynd if a rebellion were to occur. However, the Kolami are not worried about the Syltaean military gaining personnel due to the lack of cultural similarities (The Kolam Brotherhood and Anglynd are Kolami, which is a cross of Dutch and Welsh, while Syltar is Syltaean, which is different from any other culture). The Kolam Brotherhood are putting all peacekeeping forces in preparation of a Syltaean uprising.
