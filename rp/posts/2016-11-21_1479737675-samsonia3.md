# GEN: Samsonia3 Plans to send Satellite into Orbit

Posted by: samsonia3

Nations involved: Samsonia3

Samsonia3's Supreme God-Emperor deems it necessary to join the space race. Unfortunately, Samsonia3 has not yet developed the technology to send manned missions into space. Instead, the Supreme God-Emperor has ordered a massive satellite to go into orbit around the earth. A leaked schematic shows a fairly normal satellite, with solar panels to power it, but there seems to be a huge fuel compartment and unknown empty area in the satellite. 
"This satellite will at least help us get into the space race! Also, who leaked the schematics? You don't know? Interrogate them all! You have? They all confessed? Well, we still need them. Just keep trackers on them at all times. What should we put in those empty spaces, anyways? I have a vague idea, but there's always time for a change of plans..."
