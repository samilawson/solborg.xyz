Nations involved: Afghanipakijikistan, Conaim

Sheikh Muhammad Ameen went on Afghanipakijikistani national radio to condemn Conaim's recent execution of a Violetist sympathizer planting a bomb at Ellen Airport.
He said that "such executions are a threat to World Peace" and that "the Violetist convert's actions were righteous and a necessity to end Conaim's oppressive dominance."

Muhammad Ameen went on to declare that "Violetists are welcome, whereas any Conaimese spotted on Afghanipakijikistani soil will be executed."

The Sultan Ahmed Abdullah Abu al-Fawaris has still not commented on the affair and is said to be hiding in the royal palace with his 27 wives, 106 security guards, and 40 goats.
