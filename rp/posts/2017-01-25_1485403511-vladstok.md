Nations involved: Vladstok, Afghanipakijikistan

The Vladstokian League of Health Professionals (VLHP) has announced an initiative to send hundreds of doctors and aid workers to the devastated areas of Afghanipakijikistan, as well as other basic supplies for the displaced citizens.

Vlad Tirgolin, Director of the VLHP, remarked that "In this time of great conflict in strife in that area of the world, we want all parties to know that the VLHP is dedicated to serving and aiding everyone that we possibly can. Our organization is not affiliated with either party in this conflict, and any armed strife against our forces will be met with condemnation and removal of all aid from the affected areas."

It is unknown whether this offer of aid is also a threat to steer these nations towards a peaceful resolution to this conflict.
