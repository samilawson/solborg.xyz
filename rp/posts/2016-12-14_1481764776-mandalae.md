# ALLIANCE: Mandalae and the Shinmin Prefecture Announce Alliance

Posted by: mandalae

Nations involved: Mandalae, Shinmin Prefecture

Mandalaean and Shinmin leaders have come to an agreement and have announced a mutually beneficial alliance between the two countries.

Mandalae will send industrial and military aid to the Shinmin Prefecture in return for various agricultural goods.

This gives Mandalae further ties within Asia and a reliable source of crops, and secures highly advanced technology for the otherwise agriculturally-centered Shinmin Prefecture.

The first shipment of arms from Mandalae to the Shinmin Prefecture has just been sent, and includes 50 WR-8 Cougar tanks, as well as 15 SR-18 fighter jets.
