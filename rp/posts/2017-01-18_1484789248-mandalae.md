# WAR: Borneo Military Outposts Mostly Destroyed

Posted by: mandalae

Nations involved: Mandalae, New Nexon, Troiya

The Troiyan troops in Borneo are near to surrender, after the unrelenting bombardment of military outposts by the Mandalaean Navy. Most of the coastal outposts are either severely damaged or utterly destroyed, with troops being taken into custody by the New Nexonian land forces.

Although air raids and paratrooper drops on behalf of New Nexon have weakened Troiya's inland forces, Borneo is proving that it won't go down without a fight.

The tides should turn when the rest of Mandalaean forces arrive in the coming days after having liberated New Yorkia.
