# GEN: Habna will build a war memorial in Deredrad

Posted by: habna

Nations involved: Habna

A nation surely can not just forget the lives of millions of innocent people and the huge scar on a nation that was thought to have been running perfectly by many.

The Habnian Civil War Memorial will be the first major project to be built in the new rebuilt city of Deredrad,
At the Entrance will fly the flags of Habna, Esteriore, and Hiachijian, and across from them, the enemy rebel flag.

The most notable features of the planned monument will be a model of Deredrad in chaos and and huge platform with little statues on it, one for each life lost.
Another platform on the outskirts of the monument will have a small statue for every life that fled to other countries.
