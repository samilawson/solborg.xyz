# MILITARY: Troiya begins development on new AFV

Posted by: troiya

Nations involved: Troiya

Although on high alert, Troiya has revealed it's new armoured fighting vehicle: the Tigrburya AS16, or simply the tigerstorm. The vehicle had been planned in early 2016 as an update to the currently used Voynavtomobil AS99 as well as the Akula AS05. Along with the alliance planned with Ampres, Foreign Minister Danill Alekseev believes that the AFV will increase the chance of Troiya having to fight against NOPS.
