# NOPS: Assasination Attempt, and NOPS

Posted by: esteriore

Nations involved: Esteriore, NOPS

A history-altering assassination attempt has just been foiled. 

This afternoon at 9:46 PM, an unidentified gunman made an attempt on the life of Prime Minister of Esteriore, Michela Caravello. She was just about to deliver one of her signature speeches when a man pulled out a concealed pistol and shot her once in waist. The gunman was shortly after gunned down by security.

Surprisingly, she continued her speech as if nothing happened. She is renown for her toughness and strict attitude, which were most likely the contributing factors to this feat of strength.

She made a speech concerning NOPS and the NAL, revealing her plans to be a part of both alliances at the same time, so Esteriore could intervene in both alliances in case of conflict.

With Hindsight, this has proved to be an extremely critical omen in recent Norrland history. If she were successfully shot and killed, this plan could have never taken effect.

For those wondering, she is currently in hospital in near-perfect condition, and will have the bullet removed from her abdomen soon, and add it to her collection of other bullets that wounded her in the past (Which has 29 bullets by the way). 

Truly a remarkable world leader.
