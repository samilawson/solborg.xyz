# LAND: Esteriore sells Newfoundland Island

Posted by: esteriore

Nations involved: Esteriore

After some recent economic troubles, Esteriore has resorted to selling the somewhat large, fairly uninhabbited island of Newfoundland.

The Island will be auctionned off starting right now. The island can be either purchased by money, or using a 'bargaining chip' (Conditions like a free trade agreement or a joint military).
