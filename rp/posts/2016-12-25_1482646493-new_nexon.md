Nations involved: New Nexon

Emperor Slender of Nexon issued a decree amending the Constitution, which now allows the Parliament to be elected by universal suffrage for anyone above the age of 13.

"It is time to bring change to our Empire," the Decree concluded after listing down all the amendments to the Constitution. "Our people shall finally have the right to vote."

The first ever election in the country's 2058 years of history is expected to be held in the year 2019 as that is the year when the current Parliament's term will end.
