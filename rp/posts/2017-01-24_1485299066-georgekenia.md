# RELIGION: Pope assassinated visiting Georgekenia

Posted by: georgekenia

Nations involved: Georgekenia, Nerisis, Madrilenos

The pope was on a suprise diplomatice venture to change Georgekenia's mynd on his proposed state, when it was believed his dinner was poisoned by a uninvited guest.
Lauren McCleanly, a 23 year olde Georgekenian mixed race heterosexual women who is 5'7" and weighs 110lbs and of unknown affiliation, has poisoned his tea with highley concentrated cyanide. She will be executed after a single sided trial in light of the obvious truth.

(In other news we do naught appreciate people trashing our dialect.)

After the blame from the Gal May attacks was put on Georgekenia and away from Habna, this extra incident surley will not sit well with the Gal Mayese. Hauwever...if all parties were to step off this may settle down.
