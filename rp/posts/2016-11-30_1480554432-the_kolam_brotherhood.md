Posted by: the_kolam_brotherhood

Nations involved: Kolam and Friends

The Anglynd Head of Transportation, Fin Frayon announced earlier, "We will not lock our citizens into this country, nor limit the possibilities of perfectly healthy Kolamis. No one in the Kolam Brotherhood is infected yet, and if one is found with the disease, they will stay home and limit their exposure to the rest of the world."  Frayon then glanced around quite frantically, "Anyone coming into the country with the disease will be sent to a localized treatment area, where they will be attended to." Kolami officials report that they have prepared all transportation centers with disease identification stations and diseased escort protocols. In case of emergency, the Chirikof Quarantine area is getting prepared for sick housing. Officials say that the Kolam Brotherhood is aware of the outbreak, and they are currently doing everything they can to prevent it from infecting the nation.
