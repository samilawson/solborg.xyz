Posted by: esteriore

Nations involved: Esteriore, Mandalae

2 of the 3 escaped terrorists that performed the recent terror attacks in Mandalae have been captured in the North American tundra by a scouting squadron of the Esterian military. They were taking into questioning by the ESP before being loaded onto a plane on course for Mandalae.

They revealed very importanat information concerning their terrorist group. They mentionned that they have an important training camp in eastern Al Ghaza. Esteriore will be sending several spies into the desert to locate the base, and kindly asks if Kataria would be willing to search for it via their Satellite.
