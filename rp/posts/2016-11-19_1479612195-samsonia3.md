Posted by: samsonia3

Nations involved: Samsonia2, Samsonia3

"Samsonia2, we demand you withdraw your forces from our Moroccan territory. Our military is much stronger. If you do not retreat, we will have to invade the Moroccan territory and take it ourselves. On another note, any boats found in the Mediterranean that belong to Samsonia2 will be torpedoed. You have 12 hours to leave Morocco, or face your demise!"

--Supreme God-Emperor
