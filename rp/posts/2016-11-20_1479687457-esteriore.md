# ALLIES: WSCN Dissolved

Posted by: esteriore

Nations involved: WSCN Members, NOPS Members, 

Esteriore has decided to dissolve the WSCN due to fear of future conflict. Prime Minister, Carver Marion, has just declared that the alliance will be disbanded immediately, as the rivalry between it and NOPS has created a toxic environment on the RMB and the RP site.

"We hope this will stabalize Norrland, and bring about an era of peace and prosperity. Even though many nations have grudges against us for creating the WSCN, We will continue to be very integral in foreign affairs. As our proposed space race has been picking up steam recently" Said the PM during a recent speech.
