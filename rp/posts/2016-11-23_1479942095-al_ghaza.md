Posted by: al_ghaza

Nations involved: Al Ghaza, Georgekenia

Al Ghazan Free Trade Association (AGFTA) has announced a trade embargo against Georgekenia due to their untrustworthiness and weak economy. "We have no intention in a trade relationship with a nation that has threatened to destroy us, and insulted our social policies," said the director of the trade association. Al Ghazan will only be willing to lift the embargo if Georgekenia becomes a more educated and intelligent nation.
