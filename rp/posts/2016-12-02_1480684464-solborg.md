__SRK has recently conducted a series of polls across the population of Solborg on the political parties they favor and their stance on this year's referenda.__

### Secular Democrats in the lead

The Prime Minister's Secular Democratic party currently leads by a narrow margin with 32% of poll respondents favoring the party. The center-right Alternative Party, which currently holds the most seats in Parliament, trails behind at 30%. It is important to note that these results are within the margin of error of 3%. In third place, the left-wing Social Democratic Party received 19% support.

### Refugees seen favorably

Included in the list of referenda up for popular vote in this election is a measure which would close the borders to all refugees and require existing refugees to obtain an alternate residence permit or be deported. SRK's poll shows that as much as 66% of respondents oppose the measure, 19% support it, and 15% remain undecided. Another measure which would create a board to analyze intelligence in high-risk countries and vet incoming refugees has overwhelming support from 64% of respondents.
