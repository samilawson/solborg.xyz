Posted by: mandalae

Nations involved: Mandalae, NOPS, Samsonia3

Mandalae's military forces across the globe were put on high alert after Samsonia3's ultimatum. 

The Bobcat Tank Battalion in Samsonia2 has moved to the border, and will take action if the NOPS alliance chooses to not accept Samsonia3's ultimatum.

Also, the Mandalaean Navy has moved two aircraft carriers, the Santandem II as well as the Armstrong, off of the coast of Samsonia3 in preparation of any kind of military engagement.

Mandalae defers to the larger NOPS alliance on whether to take action, while remaining in favor of doing so.
