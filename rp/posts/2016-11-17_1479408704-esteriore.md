# GEN: Samsonian occupation of Island

Posted by: esteriore

Nations involved: Esteriore, Samsonia, NOPS, Gothsongia

Esteriore demands that Samsonia withdraws troops from this island, as not to escalate tensions in Europe. Esteriore will not be sending any troops to Europe, as we do not want to anger any nations.

In other news, the nuclear base set up by Gothsongia has officially been removed. The nuclear weapons positionned there will be immediately dismantled, and the nuclear waste will be used in reactors for energy.
