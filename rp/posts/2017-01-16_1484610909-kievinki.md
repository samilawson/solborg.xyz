# TERRORISM: Bombing in Oulu

Posted by: kievinki

Nations involved: Kievinki, ISV, neighbouring countries

A large explosion has struck a metro in Oulu killing and wounding 72 people. 

Jyrki Nummi, the mayor of Oulu, said a backpack bomb was source of the blast in the Kievinkian city's Hollihaka district on Monday morning. The bomb was apparently detonated in the middle carriage, which was running along the platform at the time. The driver immediately halted the train and evacuated the carriages.

A witness told the Salovaaran Uutiset newspaper that gunshots were heard after the explosion, while another heard shouts in a foreign language.

The unidentified bomber was found in the wreckage with an ISV flag. CCTV shows there were two other people with the bomber at a nearby station. The police believe they are fleeing the country. 

Currently, the Oulu Police think that the bomber came from a neighbouring country due to the harsh immigration policies in Kievinki.

Kievinki has also raised its terror threat to its highest level, as we fear an another attack.
