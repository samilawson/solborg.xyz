Posted by: the_city-states_of_kataria

Nations involved: The City-States of Kataria

The Missile Defense system issued during the Esnerian conflict several weeks? Months? Ago has been almost completed. It can now destroy any known type of missile over all cities except Aldburg. Over Aldburg the chances are 1/3 because of the distance from the launch sites at New Amsterdam and Talia.

The newly created DoX(Executive Department of Exploration) has completed its first mission setting up a colony in SA and dedicated itself to the Internorrlandic Space (Initiative?). Being an Executive Branch a special election will be called for the new Secretary of Exploration next Thursday as the government hopes people will take time out of their Thanksgiving to vote.

Kataria has also refused offers to join the NOPS and has declared that it would decline similar offers to join the Khyren Pact at this time.
