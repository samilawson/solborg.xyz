# GEN: Breaking News: Al Ghazan Prime Minister Assasinated

Nations involved: Al Ghaza

This morning at 7:38 AM GST (Ghazan Standard Time), Prime Minister Ali Bahkr was assassinated while making a trip outside the Capitol Building on his way to a meeting with a governor in the Baghdad Province. 

The killer was 26 year old Muhammed Shamir, who was armed with an M-34 assault rifle, which is illegal in Al Ghaza. Shamir had been arrested just three days before for assaulting an officer in a protest, and had a scheduled hearing at 3:00 PM, just a few hours after the incident. Shamir will be tried for Assasination, and the punishment will likely be his life.

Al Ghaza does not have any checks and balances in its government other than the PM's cabinet, whom have chosen Aamir Abdul-Hakeem to replace Bahkr as the next Prime Minister (Please note that Al Ghaza does not have an elected government and the "Prime Minister" is basically an all powerful dictator). 

Riots in the capital city have escalated, and replacement PM Abdul-Hakeem has ordered military personnel to guard the city for the time being. For we do not know the next step for Al Ghaza, this time of unrest is becoming increasingly dangerous to the state of Al Ghaza.
