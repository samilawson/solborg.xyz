# WAR: SamsonXV resurfaces! 

Posted by: samsonia2

Nations involved: Samsonia2, Samsonia3, Troiya

SamsonXV has resurfaced after going silent after his outburst about the European Bolsheviks. He returned only to declare absolute war on Troiya, and then proclaimed "The Sp-Spiders are coming!" Unfortunately, due to a lack of impeachment procedures in Samsonia2, he will remain in power until the next election.

Absolute war, for Samsonia2's people, means doing all one can to defeat a nation while still maintaining some measure of security. With this said, Samsonia2 will send to Troiya:
Battle tanks: 4800
AFVs: 2450
Interceptors: 25
Attack planes: 100
Transport planes: 100
Trainer planes: 3
Transport helicopters: 100
Attack helicopters: 100
Aircraft carriers: 1
Frigates: 11
Destroyers: 20
Corvettes: 20
Submarines: 20
Coastal defense craft: 0
Frontline soldiers: 190,000
Reserve soldiers: 0

Troiya's actions must be paid for with the iron price.
