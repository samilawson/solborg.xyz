Nations involved: Esneria

Last week, a large force of hungry peasants and disgruntled merchants marched on the Holy Palace in Beijing to overthrow the Emperor Puyi and his corrupted assailants, thereby ending the 373 year old Qing rule. 

Popular uprisings began nearly a year ago, after flooding and famine struck the agricultural provinces of Shandong, Henan, and Shanxi. It soon became apparent to the humble people that these disasters were a sign sent by the gods that the mandate of heaven had shifted.

The new emperor of Esneria has been named Zhang Yong, a noble and servant of the citizens in Weifang. As he traveled through Tianjin onward to Beijing, bystanders recall noticing the cherry blossom trees bloom in his presence. 

His son Wang Wei has been named the eventual successor of Zhang Yong, and he is currently serving as a commander in the national army. 

Zhang Yong is tolerant of all religions and plans to beautify the country in order to boost the tourism industry. Additionally, he is a strong advocate of strengthening Esneria's ties with its neighbors New Nexon and the Shinmin Prefecture.
