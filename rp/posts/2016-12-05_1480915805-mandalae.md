Posted by: mandalae

Nations involved: Mandalae

Mandalae's 2 month long election cycle recently turned violent, as incumbent president Joseph Hagden was assaulted by a fascist party supporter in Placer City. The assaulter, Daniel Buckshaw, leaped out from a croud of supporters and punched the president in the jaw. 

Although the assailant was tackled and sent to prison, the incident has sparked fears in Mandalae over increasing political violence in the country perpetrated by the far-right.

President Hagden gave a brief statement on the event, saying, "I was frightened and concerned, and am just glad everything turned out OK. Political violence is condemned in Mandalae, no matter who the perpetrator is. I hope Mandalaeans can learn from this incident, and help to make our country better."

The leading right-wing candidate from the Common Separatist Group, Elizabeth Wertfell, did not comment on the assault when asked.
