# BREAKING: Habnan Agents Detained by The Ministry of Intelligence

Posted by: gal_may

Nations involved: Gal May, Habna,

The Ministry of Intelligence has detained and confiscated "official state documents" (ie passports and licences) from the Team of Habnan Agents. The Government agency has released no official statement on the subject matter.

It seems as if the already fragile ties between the two Commonwealths have snapped.
