In a speech made today in Ravens Landing Chancellor Alfapenguice stated that" The Vatican, since it is owned and governed by a secular nation, does not have a valid reason for leaving. Politics is no place for religion and religion is no place for politics, they are two separate institutions. A state governed by religion instead of law can lead to dangerous situations, and since most religions have some form of sacred unbreakable laws, a religious state would have no use for a government to make or change laws." Chancellor Alfapenguice also wished to make clear that he/she is not against religion just not in favor of a sovereign state governed by it.
