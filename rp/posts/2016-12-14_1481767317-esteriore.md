# NOPS: Esteriore responds to criticism

Posted by: esteriore

Nations involved: Esteriore, Solborg

Several Esterian politicians have responded to the recent criticisms spurted out by the NOPS Secretary General. They pointed out that NOPS should not dabble in Esteriore's domestic affairs.

They also pointed out that these 'Core values of NOPS' are clearly not enforced, as Al Ghaza, a psychotic dictatorship 100x less democratic as Esteriore, is a recognized NOPS member.

They finished off by mentioning that the recent military expansion and semi-takeover of the government is just the military flexing its muscles in reaction to foreign tensions. They do however, admit that the hijacking of the Esterian carrier was a colossal mistake by the military, and is taking full responsibility for it.
