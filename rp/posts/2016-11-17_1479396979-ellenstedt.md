Posted by: ellenstedt

Nations involved: NOPS, WSCN

Following an announcement from Gothsong that they will be installing a nuclear base on the island of Malta, the president of Ellenstedt has announced that NOPS will be installing missile defense systems throughout Odenreig, and troops will be sent to the south of the country, as well as the eastern border of Samsonia2.

The president has called these recent developments "an extremely alarming show of aggression against NOPS by the supposedly peaceful WSCN." He also made note of the fact that economic sanctions are still in effect against the government of Esteriore, and the WSCN has not improved the situation.
