# JRS: Presidential Statement on Jerusalem Agreement

Posted by: vladimirstan

Nations involved: Al Ghaza, Betiutia

I am encouraged by the agreement reached between our Sunni Crescent's neighbors to the north. This is an important step towards peace in the Middle East and showcases the power of diplomacy. The United States of Vladimirstan is prepared to assist the peacekeeping effort in Jerusalem alongside our allies.
