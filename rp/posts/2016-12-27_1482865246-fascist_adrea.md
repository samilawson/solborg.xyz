Posted by: fascist_adrea

Nations involved: Fascist Adrea, Fascist Athenia, Upper Romania

Adrea, looking for allies, has decided to agree to the Trans-Balkan Railway, suggesting that they change plans so that the railway will go through Paryea before Firz (Dubrovnik before Belgrade). Iaerme herself had also stated that she'd like to for a "Pan-Balkan League" between the nation's of Adrea, Athenia, and Romania, to act as a massive defensive alliance that will make the Balkan region act as an impenetrable defensive region. 

Trevix said that the plan for the Trans-Balkan Railway should be easily finished within the next 3 years, at least in Adrea.
