Posted by: new-indochina

Nations involved: New-Indochina

14th January of 2017, the Congress of New-Indochina gave permission to allow our Ministry of Defense and the Army, to expand the RIN (Royal Indochinese Navy) for colonisation purposes.
We will start expanding territory on Papua and Papua New-Guinea as colonies. We will also annex the Philippine archipelago and Taiwan as direct departments. Colonisation and annexation has started today, and will continue on for the next coming times.
