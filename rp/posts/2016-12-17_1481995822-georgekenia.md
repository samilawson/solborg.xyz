# NUKES: No Need for Action say Georgekenia

Posted by: georgekenia

Nations involved: Georgekenia, others

Georgekenia is stressing again, that these nukes are exclusively defensive, to make an invasion impossible.

If we goes nuclear, say president Brody Smitters,
aney hope for Muslims or Violetists ,or weirdest case scenario Mormons, to invades our countrey, will be shattered.

Furthermore a sanction on Georgekenia would not stop the countrey, maybe slow it but naught by much.

From the first men, to the Egyptians, to the Arabs and Berbers, The Nile river valley has produced enough food for its inhabitants, and this will not change for the former Englanders of Gerogekenia.
As four other resources, We haves oil, iron is common worldwide, we already have gathereds enough uranium for our project, and if we need hydrogen, pfft, that's the most common element in the universe!
More resources are being discovered in Sudan and deep under the oceans of sand in the Sahara, and there are plenty of fish in the sea.
