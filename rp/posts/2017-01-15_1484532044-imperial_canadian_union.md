After a long and bloody civil war, Archer Lee and the Gov't forces of Slendergrad stand victorious. In accordance with their wishes, the Humanitarian Council will depart from Slendergrad, taking with it all support to people fleeing the war. The ICU will continue to send medical and building supplies for the next year to assure that all displaced peoples will not face hardship.
