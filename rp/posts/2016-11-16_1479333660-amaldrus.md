# HABNA: Amaldrussian Referndum Starts tomorrow 

Posted by: amaldrus

Nations involved: Amaldrus, Habna

Even as the civil war in Habna seems to be being won by the government of Habna, Amaldrus is still receiving refugees and is troubled with the rebuilding problems of the homelands because the government is taxing them.
So today Amaldrus decided that tomorrow they will start a referendum on independence from Habna.
Premier Moah of Habna has not shown any concern on whether Analdrus stays or not- this fact that he does not even seem to care further urges Amaldrussians to govern themselves.
