Seemingly out of nowhere, Empress Aulmerri of Hiachijan and Emperor Slender of New Nexon have proposed a marriage to each other.

The wedding is set to take place at the top of the Khyren Citadel, in Hiachijan's capital city. Empress Aulmerri and Emperor Yhumeni have promised to world leaders that those who arrive will be treated with respect.

The wedding is scheduled to occur tomorrow at 3:00 PM, Default Hiachijan Time. There will be served a wide arrange of foods and desserts (including human meat, only to be eaten by Hiachijanese). So far, the leaders of Esteriore, United Texico, and Raikkonia will be attending.
