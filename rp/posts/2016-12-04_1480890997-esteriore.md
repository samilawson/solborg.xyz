Posted by: esteriore

Nations involved: Esteriore, North American Nations, NOPS

After the recent terror attacks in New Telemark, Esteriore has begun tightening security in the country, like requiring background checks before purchasing any weapon (Guns and Combat Knives), limiting travel to and from Middle Eastern nations and increased Police spending.

Security cameras will be installed in high-risk areas like Airports and Train Stations. More Guards will also patrol the mentioned locations. A Terrorism Hotline has been established to contact the Police if there is a (or multiple) suspected Terrorist(s) acting aggresively. Internet usage will also be monitored.
