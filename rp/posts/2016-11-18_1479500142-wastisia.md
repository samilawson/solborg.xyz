# GEN: Wastisia joins NOPS

Posted by: wastisia

Nations involved: Wastisia, Paninyava, Stoichia, NOPS

The PM of Wastisia has announced today that they will join NOPS. He has stated that the reason behind this is Stoichia's recent lack of military support in Wastisia and at the border between Wastisia and Paninyava. They fear that Stoichia may stop supporting Wastisia and they will have to protect themselves against the rising Paninyavan threat.

Paninyava has always been a rival of Wastisia and Stoichia because of the Stpichian-Paninyavan war and the independence of Wastisia from Paninyava.

The PM thinks that Paninyava joined WSCN to strike fear into Stoichia and Wastisia and also gain power to attack Wastisia.

Wastisia hopes their 'Big Brother',Stoichia , will join NOPS so they can easily be protected by them this way.
