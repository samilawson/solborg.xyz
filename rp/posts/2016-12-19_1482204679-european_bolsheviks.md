# WAR: European Bolsheviks accepts Peace Treaty

Posted by: european_bolsheviks

Nations involved: European Bolsheviks, Fascist Adrea, European Bolsheviks, Esteriore

The European Bolshevik Party accepts Adrea's conditions, as long as the terms in the original treaty proposed by the Party which do not conflict with Adrea's offer are upheld. 

That is the request that foreign occupiers will not hold nuclear weapons on territory below the demarcation line along the Danube.

Pyotr Arashenko will sign the treaty once compliance by other combatants is confirmed.

The people of the PREB hope to live a prosperous future where the Bolsheviks and the Adreans can celebrate their everlasting unity.
