Nations involved: Fascist Adrea, Esneria

In the wake of the revolution in Esneria, Adrea has offered refuge to the former government of the nation, or what remains of it. Adrea has also announced that it will not recognize any new government formed in the nation as legitimate.

Before leaving Firz for her humble home in which she sleeps, Iaerme Pales made a statement referring to the nation as a "now-lawless wasteland, recovering from a quick war that resulted in a loss for the world." And said that "Adrea's might will protect it's friends when necessary, however we will avoid any abroad conflicts for the time being."
