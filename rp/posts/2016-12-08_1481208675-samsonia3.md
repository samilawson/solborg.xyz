# NUKES: Samsonia3 Quietly Hides Nuclear Weapons

Posted by: samsonia3

Nations involved: Samsonia3, Solborg

Samsonia3 has decided not to join the NOPS after further review. They will keep their still-undisclosed amount of nuclear weapons and free their Madagascarian Colony. The Supreme Leader is expected to release a plan for a possible Coalition of Rogue Nations. 

On another note, the Supreme God-Emperor kindly asks the European Bolsheviks to stop the unicorn nonsense. By kindly asking, he means to stop discussing it and to show it to us for research or risk us coming in and taking it. Since the Bolsheviks are new, the God-Emperor will remind them that Samsonia3 is one of the most militarily advanced countries.

Speaking of Military, Samsonia3 has begun development of 4 new military items:

The S3-500 Warplane -- These planes will use technology from our satellite to fly as high and as fast as possible. Will be used to transport troops/humvees on occassion.

The S3-999 Submarine -- Subs patrolling our territory, ready to stop any attack

The S3-007 Tank -- Extremely Fast, mobile tank. Used to clear out areas fairly quickly.

The S3-008 Tank -- Extremely slow, but extremely powerful. Packs an explosive punch that will be used to take down military bases.

None of these weapons are fully developed yet.
