Despite the constant attack now pushed onto the Mormon state, an attack was still managed this Christmas Eve on the Town of Troy, a brigade has shot 878 people in the small city's square. All 25 members of the brigade were killed by authorities. A fire started and has not yet been put out.
Tommorrow Conaim will consider removing all Mormons from the country, preferably far away enough so they won't help the Mormon state.
