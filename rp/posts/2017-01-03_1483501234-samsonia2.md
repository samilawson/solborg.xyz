Posted by: samsonia2

Nations involved: Samsonia2, Samsonia3, European Bolsheviks

SamsonXIV has passed after his lengthy battle with arsenic poisoning! Here were SamsonXV's words after his death:

 "H-H-His l-last words w-were just Bolshev-Bolsheviks. THEY HAVE COMMITTED TH-THIS CRIME ON MY FATHER! TH-THEY'RE E-EVERY-EVERYWHERE!!! E-EXECUTE EMERG-EMERGENCY OPERATION 148 AND GRANT ME AUTHORITATIVE POWERS! THE BO-BOLSHEVIKS WILL BE CRUSHED! MM-MOBILIZE THE ARMY!!!" 

SamsonXV is rumored to have developed Schizophrenic Paranoia after his father's poisoning triggered it. But, he is now the leader of Samsonia2 and must be treated with the respect that title commands. 

Samsonia2's army has been mobilized.
