Posted by: democratic_republic_of_cacusia

Nations involved: Cacusia, afghanipakijikistan

Cacusian leadership responded to allegations from afghanipakijikistan about using civil war to make land grabs. The Cacusian leadership said "afghanipakijikistan has no right to the Cacusian colony. They never had a claim to it because it was always owned by the people of Nepal and Tibet, never the Afghans or Pakistanis. Cacusia will regard any infraction on its land as an unprovoked act of war on a peaceful nation and will be sure the harshest possible sanctions are placed on afghanipakijikistan. Cacusian leadership also would warn afghanipakijikistan that they have defense forces and are a member of NOPS. Tread very carefully afghanipakijikistan.
