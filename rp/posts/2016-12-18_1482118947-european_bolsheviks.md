# WAR: Winter is nigh

Posted by: european_bolsheviks

Nations involved: European Bolsheviks, Fascist Adrea, Esteriore

The Revolutionary Worker's Council has forced the entirety of the PREB's population into the subway tunnels beneath Budapest, Kosice, Rzeszow, Kielce, and the capital Lublin.

The Conflict along the border with Adrea has halted almost completely, however the Revolutionary Army is still slowly retreating towards Budapest. 

The European Bolshevik Party has seized to communicate with all Ministries and government departments, most of which have been liquidated by the Party Leader Pyotr Arashenko. The Dear Leader has stated that he is willing to hold a meeting and negotiate potential peace terms with Esteriore and Fascist Adrea. 

A secret ally of the PREB has offered assistance if European Bolsheviks resort to launching a Nuclear strike.
