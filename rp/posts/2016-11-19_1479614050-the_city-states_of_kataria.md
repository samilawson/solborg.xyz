# ECO: Jokovia and Kataria agree to the ENS

Posted by: the_city-states_of_kataria

Nations involved: The City-States of Kataria, Jokovia

Jokovia has become the first nation to sign into the ENS  proposed by Secretary Julian Arriah (Entente between Neutral States). The ENS is a informal non-binding resolution that encourages the WSCN and the NOPS to stay out of these neutral nations. ENS nations may decide to defend their neutrality together but do not have to. (In the real world it is similar to the agreement between Belgium and Britain before WWI.) Other nations have been invited but any nation may join by sending a telegram to the member states.
