Posted by: odenreig

Nations involved: Odenreig

The newly created Odenian Space Exploration Agency has decided to begin a probably multi-decade project of terraforming and colonizing the planet Tæl, known commonly as Mars. The OSEA is currently working on a Radiant Energy Device, so as to be able to meet the energy requirements needed for this feat.
