In a press conference,Texican President Chuck Chong announced his plan to build a Trans-American Oil Pipeline stretching across North America and Central America. He revealed that his staff had been negotiating with the governments of Mandalae, Esteriore, New Telemark, Skloz, Tulsakatan, Skolborg, Carrodon, Conanim, New Woking, Icesage, Viadimirstan, Anauak, Toadtopia, Jokovia, Hispatia, MarcoRubiosta and Samsonia3 to get involved in the initiative.

"Mandalae will play a critical role in this proposal," the 28 year old President said, hinting at the North American League founder's influence on the continent to persuade others to take part in the project.  "This pipeline will create thousands of jobs, strengthen the regional economy by providing easier access to oil and overall act as a stepping stone towards bringing the Americas closer together."

So far, New Woking is the only country to have turned down the offer. "The Wokian government official whom I talked to said that their country has enough oil from their allies," the President replied when asked by a reporter ok why the Wokian government declined the offer.
