# ECO: Rolling out the Green Carpet in Schools (and hopefully the world)

Posted by: toadtopia

Nations involved: Toadtopia, any nation wishing to join

Further expanding on its environmental powerhouse, Congress, the Education Department, and the Environmental Protection Agency of Toadtopia have decided to expand connections to the outdoors at a young age. 

Each kindergartner will plant a tree and take care of it through their time in primary education. Students will also have more opportunities to go on camping trips with the school to expand their knowledge and comfort level with nature. 

This is all in an effort to make sure the next generation holds the environment dear and to continue the values of Toadtopia. Lastly, we reach out to any nation willing to join in this program in any way.
