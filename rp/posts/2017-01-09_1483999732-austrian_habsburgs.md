# ECO: Economic Resturcturing 

Posted by: austrian_habsburgs

Nations involved: Austrian Habsburgs

Following the recent global economic crash, the Republic of Austrian Habsburgs plans to rebuild its economy to be more self-reliant, whilst still playing a role in the international market. 

Austrian Habsburg Financial Minister Stefan Gruetsch said in an interview with ORF 1 that "Austrian Habsburgs has been too dependent on foreign imports and hasn't been exporting enough products." 

As a result of the crash, sales from Scandinavian companies have dropped significantly in Austrian Habsburgs, whereas localized industries have risen more than ever. Economists expect this fluxuation to even out again once the global economy has been stabilized.
