Posted by: hiachijan

Nations involved: Hiachijan, Mandalae, Esteriore, North American League members

Aware that opportunities to make alliances will be uncommon considering their ideologies, the people of the Alventocracy have accepted their invitation into the North American League.

Additionally, the people have been informed in Esteriore's change in ideology. Emperor Yhumeni himself commented, saying, "We care little of what ideology they adopt. What matters is that they are a good friend to the Alventocracy, and should they need it, we'll be providing additional militaristic power."
