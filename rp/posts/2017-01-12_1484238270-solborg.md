Posted by: Solborg

Nations involved: Solborg, NOPS, European Bolsheviks, Ellenstedt, Berniereich, Cacusia, Firge, Gronlandia

Jans Åkesson, Secretary General of NOPS, has negotiated an agreement with the government of European Bolsheviks regarding the nuclear program. If the agreement is approved by the general membership of NOPS, the Bolsheviks may continue their nuclear program but face severe restrictions on the level of enrichment and number of reactors allowed. Åkesson commented on the agreement earlier today, calling it "a success for diplomacy as a more effective model for international cooperation." NOPS members will be voting on whether to adopt its terms soon. The full details are available in a dispatch.

Regarding the recent aggressive and surprising actions from the government of the Berniereich against Cacusia, who has recently joined NOPS, defensive measures have been taken. About 2000 Ellenstedtian troops have been stationed along the border with the Bernierech, acompanied with an estimated 200 AFVs. Two Gullandian naval destroyers from a military base in Gronlandia have been relocated south of the Sodor Isles. A number of planes from the Firgian air force have also been stationed near Kolding.
