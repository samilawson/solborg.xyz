Nations involved: Esteriore, The Kolam Brotherhood, Hiachijan, New Nexon, Conaim, Utah

After a couple days of reorganization in the Esterian government, we are now ready to commence responding to issues again.

First off, we would like to formerly announce that Esterian PM Michela Caravello will be attending the wedding of Empress Aulmerri and Emperor Slender.

Michela Caravello is growing tired of the Mormon War in Conaim, and has formulated a plan to bring an end to the conflict. The Mormons of Utah will be given a small reserve of land on Baffin Island. Trucks are already making their way toward Conaim to transport the Mormons to the island. Reparations for the damage caused by the mormons will be handled by Esteriore very soon.

In other news, aid will be sent to the impoverished sections of the Kolam brotherhood. Cars, Food, Water, construction supplies and even money will be given to the citizens via transport jets. The first wave of goods is expected to arrive later today.
