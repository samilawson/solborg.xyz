Posted by: stoichia

Nations involved: Stoichia, Paninyava, Ellenstedt, Firge, Esteriore, Solborg, Hiachijan

Recently, a relatively new organization under the name of Faktasjekker (FactChecks) has recently leaked some secret government documents from Stoichia.

It has been revealed that the documents are future plans, by the Stoichian Government, to start the building of spy networks in 7 diffrent countries. Faktasjekker (FactChecks) has revealed 4 of the 7 countries. The 4 countries are Firge, Ellenstedt, Paninyava and Esteriore.

The PM, Garth Lovren, has said that all of the documents are fake and Faktasjekker is lying to everyone because they want to make the people believe the current government is bad.

Many people have had speculations on the 3 other targets, the highest of which have, by far, been Solborg and Hiachijan. People believe this because while Solborg does not have a big army, it has a lot of influence in world politics.On the other hand Hiachijan has had many records on not respecting civil rights which makes them a very popular choice.
