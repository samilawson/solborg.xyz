# NUCLEAR: Adrean Inspectors held up at border, Eruopean Bolsheviks confused

Posted by: european_bolsheviks

Nations involved: European Bolsheviks, Fascist Adrea, NOPS, LRN

Recently, a group of Adrean inspectors accompanied by excessive military personnel arrived unexpectedly at the border crossing in Budapest, demanding passage onto European Bolshevik Territory.

What initially seemed like a small invasion, later revealed to be an attempt by Adrea to gain unauthorized access Nuclear Power Plants in the People's Republic.

Border Guards contacted their supervisors, and quickly the situation was clarified. Joschko Dovanov, officer of border security, told the misinformed inspectors that "they have obviously mistaken the agreement between European Bolsheviks and NOPS as an invitation to Adrea to march onto proletarian soil, when in fact a treaty with the LRN was dismissed after the Immortal Dear Leader signed the document involving NOPS."

No LRN inspectors are permitted to visit Nuclear Power Plants in the People's Republic, given that this situation has already been resolved by allowing NOPS to regulate European Bolshevik Nuclear Energy.
