# CIVIL WAR: Mandalae Attempting to Quell Kolami Invasion, Rebels

Posted by: mandalae

Nations involved: Mandalae, the Kolam Brotherhood, NAL

Although the invasion by the Kolam Brotherhood was extremely surprising, the Mandalaean government states that it is "confident" that the Kolami army can be defeated swiftly.

As we speak, the Mandalaean Navy is making its way to the Kolami capital, New Kodiak, where it will blockade the city until the Kolami surrender.

Meanwhile, the Kolami army has been halted in Alaska, despite their best efforts to connect with the rebels in New Harrison.

Zorfum has become the fascist rebels' de-facto capital, and they are dubbing their nation the "Free States of Mandalae" (FSM). Efforts to leave the republic have been utterly halted in the Gulf and Watson provinces, leaving the rebel forces surrounded in New Harrison (even as the Kolami army advances in Alaska).

The Kolam Brotherhood has been ejected from the NAL with their invasion, for violating the basic principle of the treaty: non-aggression towards other members.

Joseph Hagden, fresh off of his election victory, is faced with trying to repulse foreign invaders and hold the nation together at the same time. He has called the leaders of Esteriore and Conaim to try and get them to intervene on Mandalae's behalf.
