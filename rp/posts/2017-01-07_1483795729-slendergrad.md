# COUP: Coup in Slendergrad!

Posted by: slendergrad

Nations involved: Slendergrad

A military coup occurred in Slendergrad today as President Anthony Lee was deposed by the Slendergradian military, which was dissatisfied with his ineffectiveness in combating the radical Slenderian insurgents. The President was reportedly shot dead by distant cousin Archer Lee, who is the head of the notorious Slendergradian Military Intelligence Branch (SMIB). Until an election could be held, the SMIB director is currently interim President of the country.

Special forces such as the Republican Guards and the Defence Companies were mostly responsible for taking control of the capital, while regulars secured the rest of the country for Archer. SMIB agents also arrested many of Anthony's supporters and placed them under house arrest. Others, such as the Cabinet members, were simply shot dead. Every street in the capital is currently occupied by soldiers, AFVs and tanks.

The President was the last to be taken care of. The Presidential Palace was attacked by ground troops loyal to Archer and attack helicopters, before they finally captured the President after a lengthy battle with his bodyguards and their leader executed him. The palace was in a state of severe damage after rockets fired from the helicopters obliterated parts of it.
