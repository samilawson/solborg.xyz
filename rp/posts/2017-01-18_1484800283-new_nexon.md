# WAR: Nexonan Regulars Invaded Borneo!

Posted by: new_nexon

Nations involved: New Nexon, Nanyang (colony), Troiyan Borneo, Mandalae

The Nexonan government has decided to step up the action in Borneo by deploying a small force of 6,000 soldiers from the homeland and 8,000 soldiers from the colony to the northern coastal areas of Borneo. So far, they have already seized the island of Labuan.

In addition, Nexonan airplanes are also giving firearms and munitions to pro-independence rebels in order to further disrupt Troiyan control over the island. Anti-Troiyan pamphlets are dropped from aircrafts en masse, while Nexonan intelligence agents spread revolt-inciting messages across Borneo's online communities and social media. So far, the cities of Miri and Bintulu have been taken by pro-independence rebels.
