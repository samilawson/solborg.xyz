# GEN: Clarification

Posted by: esteriore

Nations involved: Esteriore

Esteriore is just clarifying a mistake made on their part. Soldiers sent into Betuitia are just an act of intimidation. All soldiers sent there are instructed not to kill anyone. If attacked, soldiers will attempt to capture the attacker. They will also accompany refugees in the country, and send them to a ship on course for Esteriore. We are very sorry for the lack of this detail.
