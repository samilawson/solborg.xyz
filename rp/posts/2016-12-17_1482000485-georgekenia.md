# WAR: Georgekenia refuses to go to war

Posted by: georgekenia

Nations involved: Georgekenia, Samsonia3

Georgekenia is naught going to fight with Samsonia3, it's naught a fair fight.

We are just putting our progrom on temporary lockdown and we are naught mobilizing forces, instead we have an unarmed peace brigade surrounding Cairo, and another around Alexshire.

They are hair going to stand there want to sign a peace document with Samsonia.
