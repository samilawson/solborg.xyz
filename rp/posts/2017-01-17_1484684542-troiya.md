# INVASION: Troiya and Ialicus invade New Yorkia

Posted by: troiya

Nations involved: Troiya, New Yorkia, Ialicus, Keory

At 8:00 PM, Ialicusan and Troiyan ships filled with 50,000 Troiyan soldiers and Ialicus' army leave port. After an hour, they are embargoed by Keoryan ships, which outnumber them. Medium-ranged missiles are used to destroy most of the ships while Troiyan destroyers attack the rest.
In the late hours of the day, the army arrives at New Yorkia and an invasion begins. The country with only a small population of 6,000,000 is overwhelmed by the force and is invaded quickly.

New Yorkia mainland will be split in half, the bottom half being occupied by Troiya and the top half being occupied by Ialicus. A small neutral zone inbetween will be puppeted by Troiya. The New Yorkian Canadian Colony will be occupied by Troiya while the Northern Territory will be occupied by Ialicus.
