# INTERNAL: President Archer Lee Officially Inaugurated!

Posted by: slendergrad

Nations involved: Slendergrad, New Nexon

An unexpected guest arrived at President Archer Lee's inauguration today as His Imperial Majesty Emperor Slender of Nexon's official airplane landed at Kingsford Smith International Airport and the Emperor was transported in his customised Bugatti Royale limousine to the Palace of Sydney, escorted by a motorcade of over 150 cars which consisted of armoured luxury sedans, SUVs and high-speed APCs filled with heavily-armed Nexonan imperial guards and SMIB agents specially trained as bodyguards. Special forces soldiers also joined in the procession. Over 200 sharpshooters were positioned around the route, while a crowd of 350,000 cheered at the Emperor, who waved back at his worshippers.

The Emperor didn't speak much during the official inauguration ceremony except during the swearing-in of the Slendergradian President. The President, an avid lover of automobiles, was gifted a Mercedes Benz SLR McLaren by the Emperor. The signal was clear to the rest of the international community - Archer Lee may not be the ideal choice, but he must be tolerated for now. Emperor Slender is expected to stay in Sydney for a few more days at a private palace before returning back to Nexon.
