# SANCTIONS: Cacusia sanctions and Centralstani reparations 

Posted by: imperial_canadian_union

Nations involved: Imperial Canadian Union, Centralstan, Cacusia

After the recent outburst by the Emperor the other day, along with the new invasion by Cacusia, the Emperor felt it necicarry to speak again to the public, to an end that we, the news, did not see coming.

"Today is a day of mourning, reports are coming in of a totally uncalled-for attack on the Centralstani people, and now is not the time to be divided. Yesterday, I made a statement to which I humbly apologize for, and meant nothing by it. I bear the shame of said mistake, and will continue to serve, for the next month, as head of state. After that time I will abdicate my throne in favor of my son, who has been taught to be a better leader than his father. As for the billion Centralstani dollars sent to us yesterday, they will be spent on medical supplies to aid in the restoration of peace between our two great nations. Another important message I had for everyone today was the fact that henceforth, the Imperial Canadian Union will be cutting all ties with the Republic of Cacusia, for their brutally uncalled for attack on the innocent civilians of Centralstan and Afghanipakijiastan."
