# MADRILENOS CONDEMNS NERISIS, SEEKS AUTONOMOUS VATICAN CITY: RELIGION

Posted by: madrilenos

Nations involved: Madrilenos, Nerisis

Recently, his holiness Archbishop Amadeo condemned the corrupt government of Nerisis for its blasphemous governance, and said that it should relinquish control over Vatican City to the International Catholic Church. 

When asked about Nerisis, Archbishop Amadeo quoted scripture, specifically Luke 12:15, "And He said to them, 'Take heed and beware of covetousness, for one’s life does not consist in the abundance of the things he possesses", and Proverbs 29:2 “When the righteous increase, the people rejoice, but when the wicked rule, the people groan.” 

Nerisis is unfit to govern Vatican City, due to its reputation tainted by gambling, corruption, and oppression. As a Historically significant territory of Christendom, the Madrilenos Catholic Church firmly advocates and pleas to the International community, that Vatican City should become autonomous.
