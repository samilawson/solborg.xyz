Nations involved: New Nexon, Solborg, other countries 

A pearl white-coloured Mercedes Benz 540 K Special Roadster was just delivered to the official residence of Solborgian Prime Minister Cooper Johnston. The person who gave this 6 million Nexonan Pounds (11.7 million United States Dollar) gift was His Imperial Majesty Emperor Slender of Nexon.

In order to fit the PM's personal preferences, the car had been modified to run on electricity. It was personally driven by Edison Cheng, the President of the Overseas Nexonan Association in Solborg, to the PM's residence. Other luxury gifts, such as rare bottles of wine and luxury watches, have also been given to other friendly heads of states by the Emperor to symbolise good relations between them.

It was suspected that the Solborgian PM received such an exquisite gift because of his advices to the Nexonan Emperor, which resulted in the Imperial Decree on Democratisation of the Legislatire. Said decree gives Nexonans the right to vote for their legislators for the fist time in history. The PM also played a crucial role in Nexon's entry into the NOPS.
