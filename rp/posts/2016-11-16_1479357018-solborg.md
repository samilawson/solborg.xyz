# GEN: Norrland Organization for Peace and Security (NOPS)

Posted by: solborg

Nations involved: Solborg, Stockgrove, Ellenstedt, and the rest of Norrland

Stockgrovean PM Mason Sanders, Solborgian PM Cooper Johnston, and Ellenstedtian President Hubbard Krause met today in Berlin, Ellenstedt, and discussed the creation of an international military alliance. The purpose would be to ensure the security of smaller nations and to collectively unify many peace-oriented nations to exert a stronger influence on the rest of Norrland.

The alliance has been named the Norrland Organization for Peace and Security, or NOPS. Members are expected to contribute troops for military training, support other members in military conflicts, and consult other members before taking any military action to ensure cooperation for greater effectiveness and unity.

So far, Stockgrove, and Ellenstedt are members. Firge and Magma Bananas are expected to join in the near future. Solborg will put the matter to a referendum, which is expected to pass. Many people suspect the new government of Esteriore may be encouraged to join as well.
