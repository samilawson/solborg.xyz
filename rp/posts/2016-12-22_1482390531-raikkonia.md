Posted by: raikkonia

Nations involved: Raikkonia, Eijafoss

Raikkonia finalized plans on a northern canal today, a large-scale public works project initially proposed by president Korpela himself. The plan absorbs Eijafoss' border near Klevtorp, the land being used by Raikkonia to create a canal in exchange for certain benefits.

After being viewed by regional environmental specialists and politicians alike, plans passed through Parliament and construction was greenlit.

The plan, aiming to add extra connections between the Atlantic Ocean and Bothian Gulf, looks to benefit northern and western countries, as well as capital New Kovalania due to increased trade. Countries south and east of Solborg are not expected to see as much of a gain.

The time for completion is not known, but Raikkonia has also offered to give benefits to countries which aid in its construction.
