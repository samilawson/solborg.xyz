# SPACE: EHSP makes extreme change in plans

Posted by: amaldrus

Nations involved: Amaldrus, Habna

After hearing the outrageous claim by Solborg that they will "conquer" the moon, EHSP has decided to make the mission to the moon a mission to Mars instead to "conquer" it for the Amaldrussian people and the Habnian race as a whole.

The shuttle will now be bigger, have more resources, and carry more people, and also has a sedative system for thoose who don't have to keep watch.

The shuttle will plant a two-flagged flagpole on Mars, the Habnian flag on one side. And Amaldrus on the other, at equal height.

This is another important step not only in the rise of a stronger Amaldrus but also a return of confidence and secure feelings in war-torn Habna.
