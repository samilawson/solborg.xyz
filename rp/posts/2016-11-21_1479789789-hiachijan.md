# SPACE: Hiachijan Changes Plans

Posted by: hiachijan

Nations involved: Hiachijan

The Emperor and Empress have been doing research into Venus's atmosphere, and have made a change of plans.

While the concept and development of the Venusian spacesuit has not been abandoned, we have made a change of plans in how to approach Venus. We will not be focusing on the surface, but rather atmospheric colonization.

Hiachijan's new target for colonization is the Venusian tropopause; the most Earth-like environment in the Solar System. The atmosphere at this altitude is almost equivalent to that of Earth, and the temperature ranges from 32 to 122Â°F. Protection from cosmic radiation would be provided by the atmosphere above, with shielding mass equivalent, again, to Earth. More importanly, composition of the tropopause gases (21% oxygen, 79% nitrogen, again, similar to Earth) would remove the need for breathing masks or such.

Hiachijan is currently researching resistance to acidic corrosion, so that the sulfuric acid does not corrode the colony's materials and quite literally, possibly fall to its doom. Additionally, because the Hiachijanese are so fearful of such a fate, the mission will not be manned, at least, not the probe we plan on sending right now. However, we are making sure a manned mission will be ready upon a probe's success.
