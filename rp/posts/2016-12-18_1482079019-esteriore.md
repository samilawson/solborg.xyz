Posted by: esteriore

Nations involved: Esteriore, European Bolsheviks

Esteriore is sending over 5000 aircraft to European Bolsheviks to begin air raids and bombings of military bases. Others will also be used for reconnaissance missions on the whereabouts of important bases and towns.

An aircraft carrier is also making its way towards Adrea's coast to deliver supplies such as gas or food and 5,000 troops. Up to now, the tally for the number of Esterians dead is over. 4,500 Male & Female Soldiers. This is however, expected to rise in the coming days as 'Operation Red' has commenced. It will focus on the capture of important civilian centers across Bolshevik lands.
