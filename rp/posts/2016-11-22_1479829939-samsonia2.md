# GEN: With Halvarda Gone, Samsonia2 Hosts International Celebration Plus Referendum Results!

Posted by: samsonia2

Nations involved: Samsonia2, all who choose to participate

In light of Halvarda's banning, Samsonia2 would like to hold an international get-together celebrating the event. Since the lower Parliament voted in favor of the Trade Union 334-101, this party will also be held to discuss the Trade Union and what it will mean to member nations. This is not mutually exclusive with any other alliances. RSVP if you want to attend!
