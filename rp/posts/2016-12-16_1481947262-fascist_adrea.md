# NUKES: Adrea Hates Nukes, As Per Usual

Posted by: fascist_adrea

Nations involved: Adrea, Georgekenia

Iaerme Pales, the always-busy international critic, has come out with a statement against Georgekenia, denouncing them directly, and any sort of nuclear ability they gain. She states that the "only thing anyone should ever do with nuclear power is electricity."

In a more controversial statement immediately afterwards, she's quoted as saying that "The LRN, or at the very least, Adrea, will not fear a war to remove the nuclear possibility from this nation. We were too late to stop it where nukes already exist, but we will prevent a new nuclear power from rising at all costs."

She has now officially pushed a proposal to both NOPS and LRN administration, to push forward a Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty.
