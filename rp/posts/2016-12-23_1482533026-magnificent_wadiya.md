Posted by: magnificent_wadiya

Nations involved: Magnificent Wadiya, Karlsfell, United Texico

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has announced that Magnificent Wadiya has signed a 800 million dollar Oil deal with the Kingdom of Karlsfell.

According to disclosed government documents, the deal will be terminated by the end of FY 2018. Karlsfell will receive 55% of the profits and Wadiya the remaining 45%. An Inspector from Karlsfell is currently examining potential sites to begin drilling before January 2017.  

Additionally, Admiral General Aladeen has stated that he hopes to engage in another trade deal with United Texico, given that many Oil reserves remain untouched. Alan Kyle has been invited to visit Magnificent Wadiya to discuss the benefits and details of a prospective Oil agreement.   

The Wadiyan economy has already experienced a boost as a result of foreign investments in the small East African nation.
