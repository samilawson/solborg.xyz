Posted by: solborg

Nations involved: Solborg, Stockgrove, Ellenstedt, Mandalae, Esteriore

Mandalae has recently joined NOPS, giving the organization a strategic location in North America and the Pacific (Mandalae has a colony in Hawaii). Magma Bananas and Firge have also joined, giving NOPS significant influence in Europe. Vladimirstan, another large North American military power, is expected to follow suit.

An additional 4500 peacekeeping troops from NOPS nations and Solborg are being sent to Esteriore for a grand total of 15,000. NOPS is also installing comprehensive missile defense systems across all member nations. Troops have been stationed along eastern Solborg and Ellenstedt as well as the south of Mandalae.

Current opinion polls show that 57% of Solborgians support joining NOPS, while 34% oppose it and 9% remain undecided. The Prime Minister and his majority Secular Democratic Party are in favor of joining.
