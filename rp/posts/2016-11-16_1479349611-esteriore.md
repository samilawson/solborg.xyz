Nations involved: Esteriore, Peacekeeping Nations

Prime minister of Esteriore, Carver marion held a public press conference thanking the nations that sent soldiers to maintain peace in the nation.

"I sincerely thank all the nations that have been supporting us in these difficult times. The 1st amendment to the constitution will be signed later tonight. This amendment will hopefully ease tensions in the nation and prevent secessions from happening anytime soon. We will also be expanding welfare and the national health service to aid the poor of the nation and those affected by our crumbling economy. While this peacekeeping mission is going on, i'd also like to discuss the sanctions that are still currently in place on our nation".

The prime mister then leaves the room abruptly.
