Posted by: samascanbown

Nations involved: Samascanbown Hiachijan

Hiachijan has permitted military action if you may call it, currently deploying forces on our southern border (Western Coast) so far our government is still getting permission from the company's that represent the local government in the areas, but soon enough, military forces will begin fortifying the southern border in preparation for the action of a counter invasion, or defense. Attack has not been permitted by Hiachijan yet, if we will be getting military support yet is not determined, it all depends on how the situation unfolds.
