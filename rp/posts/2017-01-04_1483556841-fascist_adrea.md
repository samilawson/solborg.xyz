# SOMETHING ALONG THE LINES OF NUKES AND WAR?: Adrea Kindly Requests Samsonia Politely "Stop That"

Posted by: fascist_adrea

Nations involved: Fascist Adrea, Samsonia2-3, European Bolsheviks

After the entire situation and scandal involving Samsonia and the Bolsheviks, Adrea has sent an official delegation to Samsonia2 and Samsonia3, requesting that the two nations stop military involvement in the area. Adrea, having already won a war against the Bolsheviks before, has signed a treaty with the Bolsheviks that bans military action from either side. Iaerme, a woman of honour, had decided to follow through with this treaty and request the LRN make no military action against the Bolsheviks, at least until the treaty is over. Adrea, however, requests that the Bolsheviks allow Adrean military-escorted 'inspectors' to enter the Communist nation to find and dismantle any and all nuclear capabilities, including reactors and mines. The Adrean nation has threatened to allow, and spearhead, a direct invasion into the EUB, should the deny the inspectors complete and uninterrupted access.
