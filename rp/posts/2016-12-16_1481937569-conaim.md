Posted by: conaim

Nations involved: Conaim, Utah (unrecognized)

The Sons of Utah have attack little fort Bigfoot in Mormon Country and have actually pushed Conaimese forces into retreat as most troops were out north training.

Smith City has become their capital and head of Mormon Country thinks it would be easiest if Conaim simply let the Mormons secede.

Conaim has instead voted to declare war on the new illegitimate nation of Utah

"Utah" does not claim all of Mormon country, but only southern Mormon country and vast swaths of Vladimirstan to form the original state of Utah as it existed before the salt wars back in the 1800s.

West New York, a city in Nothern Mormon country and outside of "Utah" is mostly not Mormon. This is were the small losing forces of the battle of fort bigfootmare retreating.

The battle was only 3 hours long
253 out of 500 Conaimese stationed there were killed
and 51 wounded.

The Sons of Utah brigade that attacked only lost 58 of 600.

Large amounts of troops from northern Conaim are being mobilized to retaliate.
