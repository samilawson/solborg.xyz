Posted by: georgekenia

Nations involved: Georgekenia

A meglev bullet train line is being built running from Alexshire to Cairo and then dawn the Nile river's western bank all the weigh to the nation's southen border.
It was commenced after a standard NS issue proposed it.

Meanwhile, small numbeurs of Georgekens are migrating to the newly annexed territreys of Crete and Rhodes.
Georgekenia is naught the onley nation taking land from the unorganized Greek peoples, a Sunash colony has taken over the pelopenssian peninsula.

The Greek people are extremeley unhappey.
It seems nations are leading a secret crusade to seize Greek land as mereley a superficial statement, being able to says that they owns part of the birthplace of western civilization.
Like some sort of second holy land!
