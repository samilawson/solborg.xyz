# GEN: Samsonia3 Occupies Sant Antoni de Portmany

Posted by: samsonia3

Nations involved: Samsonia2, Samsonia3, esteriore, Gothsong

In light of recent events, the Supreme God-Emperor has sent 57,335 troops to occupy Sant Antoni de Portmany, an island off the coast of Samsonia3 that is relatively close to Gothsong's most western island. We invite our Esteriorian allies to move their troops to this location, as it will place them in a much better location, closer to Gothsong as well as farther away from the barbarians in Samsonia2. If Gothsong does not hand over their WMD's to esteriore or Samsonia3, we will give them a reason to listen to our demands.
