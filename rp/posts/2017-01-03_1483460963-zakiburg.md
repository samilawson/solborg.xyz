Nations involved: ZakiBurg

A huge strike by the ZakiBurgian mine workers broke out today. The economy of the nation collapsed and the government was forced to take action. They payed the workers higher wages and the workers was pleased as they did continue to work. No one ever realized that the increased taxes were the cause to the success of Lord Zaki, the President.
