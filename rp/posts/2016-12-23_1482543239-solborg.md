The House of Representatives in New Telemark has voted against the construction of the Trans American Pipeline through the nation. Environmental Secretary Anna Petersen of the New Democratic Party called the pipeline's rejection "a good sign for the future of our planet" and called upon other nations to take similar action. President John SÃ¸rensen highlighted the dangers of climate change in a press conference, and added that other infrastructure projects are a significantly better way to create jobs.
