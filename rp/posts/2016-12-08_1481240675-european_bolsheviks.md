Nations involved: European Bolsheviks, Fascist Adrea

Following recent inciting comments made by Iaerme Pales, party officials in the Revolutionary Worker’s council have publicly criticized the Fascist Leader, calling her “an insult to democracy and a threat to world peace.”

After council meeting on December 8, Pyotr Arashenko stated in an interview with State News that “any further provocation against the People’s Republic would prompt the European Bolsheviks to seriously reconsider our diplomatic relationship with the Fascist Nation.” 

Based on reports released by the People’s Republic of European Bolsheviks’ Commission for Public Information on National Armament (P.R.E.B.C.P.I.N.A.), the nuclear program which has been in development for 24 years is nearing completion, thereby intensifying the possible consequences of growing international tensions between the People’s Republic and foreign political dignitaries. 

According to the nuclear development team, the weapons are being produced by a rare metal known as stalinium, reinforced with aluminum and tinfoil.  

Glory to our Technological Advancement!
