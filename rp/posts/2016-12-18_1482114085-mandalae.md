# ALLIANCE: Mandalae Founds the North American League

Posted by: mandalae

Nations involved: Mandalae, Conaim, Esteriore, the Kolam Brotherhood

Mandalae has chosen to leave the NOPS alliance in favor of the newly established North American League.

This new alliance will consist of any and all North American nations who choose to join, and will act as a unifying force in the continent militarily, economically, politically and culturally.

Member nations can remain neutral while in the alliance, as well as be part of alliances with other non-North American countries if they choose.
