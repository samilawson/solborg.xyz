# TERROR: Habna makes investigation breakthrough

Posted by: habna

Nations involved: Habna, Georgekenia, Gal May

New evidence suggest the terrorists who committed the attack were a straight Georgekenian couple, but they did not appear to have any direct connection to the government of their home nation, what was foun however, was evidence that there may had been Violetist connections, it seems like it was a possible attempt to destabilize Georgkenia, Habna, and Gal May, to make easier for Violetist recruitment.

The evidence will be brought to Gal Mayan officials for further consultation.
