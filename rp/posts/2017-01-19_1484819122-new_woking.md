Nations involved: New Woking, Gullandia

Following New Woking's quick exit from the election, the Prime Minister spoke out over the Scientific Research Agreement.

"Today marks a great day in the future of New Woking." The PM spoke out this morning. "We are now able to finally start working on our alliances outside of New Woking. For a long time now, we have been an independent nation, but times have changed. The world requires friends, strong bonds that can last through conflicts."

He continues. "This is why we are pleased to announce that Gullanida, the recently elected Local Minister, will be our partner in research for the foreseeable future. Discussions will begin over the next week, to begin preparations in what will be our greatest triumph."

When asked a question on the recent election, Alex Bance stated: "I have made my statement already. No more questions."
