 Dr. Serena Kent, Head of the Department of Exploration, has just released plans for a prototype of a new Corn-based Ethanol powered rocket engine. This engine was designed by the scientists at Burnham Engineering Company last week and has just been approved by the Skolborg Space Initiative and the Katari DoX for the upcoming moon mission. Hopefully it will also be approved by the other members. The rocket is remarkable because it has no need for fossil fuels relying entirely on corn ethanol which has never been possible before at an efficient scale. The only downside is that the rocket is still not as efficient as the conventional rockets and fuel would have to take up 50% more space on the rocket. Dr. Kent believes that this would be a good symbol to the world that even in a time of resource consuming space exploration we are still committed to green energy.

In other news, a bill reached the NA today that would provide incentives to corn farmers who grow a higher percentage of sweet corn and sell it to a proposed organization to distribute the food to unincorporated territories in the rest of Africa to help fight world hunger.
