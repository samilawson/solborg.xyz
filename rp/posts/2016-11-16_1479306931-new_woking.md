Nations involved: New Woking, Esteriore, Skolborg

New Woking has made plans to occupy the unclamied land between Skolborg and Esteriore. The reasoning for this is due to the small size of the nation having a population density that is too high.

The New Woking military and settlers will proceed into the land within the next week. This is New Wokings' first and only land expansion.

New Woking looks forward to making close ties with trade and protection with Skolborg.
