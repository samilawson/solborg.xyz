# ENERGY: Texico Reassures Esteriore on Oil Pipeline

Posted by: united_texico

Nations involved: United Texico, Carrodon, Esteriore, New Woking

Texican President Chuck Chong announced in a press conference that Carrodon had already allowed Texican companies to build the pipeline through its territory, thus there's no need for Esteriore to take military action against New Woking.

"As far as I am concerned, New Woking isn't even important in this initiative anymore. Carrodon, which shares land borders with Esteriore, has already given us the green light to construct the pipeline as long as it doesn't harm the environment, and we have assured them that we will do our best to ensure that the local environment won't be harmed," the President said.

So far, out of the 13 countries invited to partake in the initiative, Jokovia, Carrodon, Conaim, Esteriore, Hispatia and Skloz have accepted the offer. New Woking, New Telemark and Toadtopia have declined the offer on the other hand, ranging from outrageous demands over the share of profit, to environmental concerns.
