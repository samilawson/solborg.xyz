Posted by: new_telemark

Nations involved: New Telemark, Stockgrove, Ellenstedt, Solborg, Odenreig, NOPS

President John Sørensen of New Telemark has announced that he supports the decision of the NOPS Secretary General to remain neutral, and measures will be taken to establish a state of armed neutrality in New Telemark. The nation's missile defense systems are being tested for effectiveness and expanded to cover a majority of the country. Currently, around 40% of the population is covered.

Troops are being stationed along the borders, and the navy is now increasing patrols along the Atlantic coast. Two aircraft carriers and multiple destroyers are being sent to the Baltic Sea to assist European NOPS members in their defense. The air force is sending planes to bases in Stockgrove, Ellenstedt, and Solborg. President Sørensen has offered to send support to Odenreig as well.
