# SPACE: Mandalae Yields Mars to Amaldrus

Posted by: mandalae

Nations involved: Mandalae, Amaldrus

Due to the recent outcry in the nation of Amaldrus about Mandalae's percieved aggression towards a colony on Mars has prompted many in the Mandalean government to reconsider the mission, and instead look elswhere for colonies in space.

Due to this new consideration, Mandalae will, instead of sending colonists to Mars, be sending colonists to the moon of Enceladus (the 6th largest moon of Saturn).

The government of Mandalae issued a formal apology to the government of Amaldrus, and hopes to work with the nation in spurring technological, as well as inter-planetary growth and achievement.
