Today, the Gesundheitsministerium (Ministry of Health) in the Kingdom of Austrian Habsburgs has publicly announced that certain health guidelines are going to be enforced, in order to minimize the effect of the new Influenza strain which is being transmitted by birds to the population. According to government figures, 100,000 citizens have already been contaminated and are now being treated at the Hospital in New Vienna.  
As a result, the Au√üenministerium (Ministry of Foreign affairs) has announced that it is going to cooperate with the Innenministerium (Ministry of Interior) and the Finanzministerium (Ministry of Finance) to allocate 50 million Austrian Habsburg Schilling to fund the research that is being carried out abroad in Solborg and New Telemark.
