# HIACHIJAN: Hiachijan Enters a Golden Age

Posted by: hiachijan

Nations involved: Hiachijan

While they are a little late to announce it, but Hiachijan has officially entered a golden age! To celebrate our progress, our terrifying economy, and our frightening military power, cities will be undergoing massive architectural renovation projects. While buildings will not be decorative (at least, not to foreign peoples), they will be highly resilient.

Hiachijan will be turning once mildly tall buildings into massive skyscrapers, capable of withstanding the forces of hurricanes. The tallest of which will be the Khyren Capital Building, now to be known as the Khyren Citadel. Hiachijan will strive to make the Khyren Citadel the tallest building in the world. The more insignificant buildings will take on the appearance of pyramids or ziggurats.

This is a joyous time for the people of the Alventocracy.
