# CIVIL WAR: Civil War Ends

Posted by: mandalae

Nations involved: Mandalae

Mandalae's civil war has come to an end. Early in the morning of January 4th, 2017, the Mandalaean military made an advance into the city of Zorfum, the last remaining rebel stronghold.

Resistance was utterly crushed.

The remaining rebels are either fleeing the country, or about to be put behind bars. Dissenters from the Fascist Party have been detained, and will most likely face life sentences in prison after their trials.

It is a time of celebration across the nation for most. The war, which killed nearly 20,000 people in less than 3 days, shook Mandalae to its core. But now that it has recovered, it rebounds stronger than ever.

President Hagden summed up the entire scenario fairly well, saying, "This was a time of great hardship and struggle, but I believe it has made Mandalae a stronger nation. May all those who perished rest in peace, and may God bless the Socialist Republic of Mandalae!"
