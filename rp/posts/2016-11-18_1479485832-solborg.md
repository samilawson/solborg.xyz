# GEN: NOPS State of Emergency Declared

Posted by: solborg

Nations involved: NOPS

Secretary General Jans Ã…kesson from Solborg has raised the NOPS threat level to __seven__ out of ten, declaring a state of emergency. This is because of the escalating tensions between Samsonia3 and Gothsong and the involvement of nuclear weapons. During a state of emergency, the Secretary General may order the emergency stationing of troops for defensive purposes without consulting member nations. Offensive members still require support from member nations.

A dispatch with all the information about the structure of NOPS and a list of member nations is available [here](https://www.nationstates.net/page=dispatch/id=724249). A map showing the nations that belong to each alliance is available [here](http://goo.gl/HcYFNq).
