# ERROR: Emperor demands tributes to lives lost in Centralstan Blunder

Posted by: imperial_canadian_union

Nations involved: Imperial Canadian Union, Centralstan, Vaegir-Swadia, Cacusia

The infuriated Emperor demanded that the Centralstani government pay full reparations to the Vaegir and Cacusian governments as the recent blunder of a attack was made today.

The Emperor had this to say: "I SWEAR TO GOD, IF CENTRALSTAN EVEN TOUCHES EITHER OF THOSE TWO (Most likely Cacusia and Vaegir-Swadia) I'LL BURN THEM ALIVE MYSELF.

In a meeting with his top generals, he said "All right boys, prepare the Pope-Cannon. Let's show those fuckers what we're all about." The so called "Pope Cannon" is a ICBM, the largest in ICU history, whether or not it will be fired remains a mystery.
