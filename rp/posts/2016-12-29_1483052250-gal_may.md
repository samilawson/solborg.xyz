# : The Unity of the Commonwealth

Nations involved: Gal May

The Commonwealth of Gal May was created by fusing the two kingdoms Galand and May who were, at the time, lead by the same Queen. Though, now that the government has reformed to a democracy, many patriots of both nations are beginning to call for the dissolving of a century-old Union. The Prime Minister Fredrik Mathews released an official statement on the subject matter, "I find [the anti-unionists] absurd really. Even while both nations existed they were led by the same government, meaning that this 'century-long union' actually has existed under multiple kings and queens for at least four hundred years." Political analysts say that very little is likely to come from this sudden desire for independence and that it would be a waste of time to concern ourselves with it. Though only time will tell.
