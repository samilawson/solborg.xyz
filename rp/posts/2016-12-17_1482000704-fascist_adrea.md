# WAR: Adrea Declares War On Georgekenia

Posted by: fascist_adrea

Nations involved: LRN, Georgekenia

In the wake of nuclear 'threats' and the landing of Samsonians in Marsa Matrah, Adrea has officially announced that it will be supporting the Samsonian war effort in a war of its own. Adrean soldiers, excluding those patrolling the Bolshevik border and searching for the still-lost Esterian Nuke, are now piling into transport vehicles of every kind. The fledgling navy of Adrea is now moving off the suez canal, however the massive air force is now maneuvering its way over Georgekenian Airspace, some of the first arrivals (already nearby due to lucky positioning) having already striking Georgekenian military sectors upon the Northern Nile, others being shot down before being able to gain Adrean glory in combat.

Iaerme Pales has stated that "This war, unlike Samsonia's, is not only to disrupt their nuclear program, but also to gain the Suez canal, as we feel Georgekenia has been unfairly taxing passage. It only makes sense that the Suez should be free for anyone to pass through, as such, this is our goal in the war."
