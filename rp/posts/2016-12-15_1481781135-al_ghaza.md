# NOPS, FOREIGN AFFAIRS: Al Ghaza Condemns Estorioren Police Force

Posted by: al_ghaza

Nations involved: NOPS, Estoriore, Mandalae

After Al Ghaza got word of a proposed Estorioren Police Force, Ghazan leaders were outraged. Many NOPS leaders such as the secretary general himself have criticized this recent proposition. Ghazan Prime minister Ali Al-Muhammed has responded in a public statement addressing the reasoning behind this choice. "As a law abiding nation in NOPS, we are offended at such an attack on our integrity," said the PM. Al Ghaza has stood by the word of the NOPS Secretary General, who has condemned this proposition, and who Al Ghaza plans to vote for later this month. 

Additionally, Mandalae had criticized the Al Ghazan government as a corrupt theocracy, and endorsed the Estorioren propositon. Al-Muhammed had commented, "Our ties to faith should not undermine the integrity we have brought forth to the international community." As Al Ghaza continues to be criticized by fellow NOPS members over its domestic policy, anger and resentment are growing within the government.
