# SPY: Possible Cacusians Spy Brutally Exexuted

Posted by: centralstan

Nations involved: Centralstan, Cacusia

A Cacusian Man, who simply called himself Frjed,
Was accused of being a spy after he was seen eyeing and journaling about Centralstani soilders and posts.
He also was seen cartographic get and surveying the land, as if Cacusia wanted it for some reason, however it wouldn't be suprisingly if they wanted it seeing how they wanted the isles frozen lands of the Himalayas for some reason. However it would be stupid of Cacusia to attack Centralstan, the NOPS may defend them if we attack them, but they would never support weak tiny Cacusia if they were the aggressors themselves.

The man, Frjed, who never gave his last name, was dragged by crowd to a town center and was beaten against the ground by industrial equipment into his head blew off and viscera were everywhere, as if his head was a melon or coconut.

Cacusians are no longer for, this point forward allowed in the great nation of Centralstan
