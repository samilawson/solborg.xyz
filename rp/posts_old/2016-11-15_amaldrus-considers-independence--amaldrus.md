# HABNA: Amaldrus considers independence 

Posted by: amaldrus

Nations involved: Amaldrus, Habna

Amaldrus, also known by its nickname, New Habna,
Which is even showcased in its national motto,
Has been very turned off by the civil,war going on in Habna and the boatloads of refugees that can't even be sorted through because both the Amaldrussians and the immigrants are Habnian citizens.
Habna can't properly govern Amaldrus anymore,
Governer Prime Chuck says, If Moah can't even get a hold of provinces back home we must keep the peace here ourselves.
We also don't want to be open to expansion of the conflict here which could happen if enough of the refugees were from the rebels instead of the middle class.
