Yesterday, the Liberal Party won a majority of seats in Parliament. Its program, based on liberalization of the economy and the state, has been widely plebiscited. However, the Liberal Party of John Luke was forced to form a coalition with the party Roots and Traditions, a hard right political movement that received 11% of votes, based on a political agenda that provides a drastic increase in the budget of national defense and homeland security at the expense of spending on the poor and foreign aid. Jon Adler, the party leader of Roots and Traditions, asked that the new parliamentary majority to put in place "a powerful and magnificent army".

In his inaugural speech to both Houses of Parliament in Congress, John Luke said :

"It is time to return to clear principles : simplicity, transparency and efficiency. We must replace our incomprehensible tax system by a limited range of taxes at the lowest rates. VAT works well. A single and proportional income tax would yield as much as the total contributions and income tax without raising the current releases of taxpayers who feel expropriated. Citizens regain confidence in the state when its operating invoice will be clear again, tolerable and readable by all. Heavily reduce the level of the taxes is essential. Ensuring their stability also.

But remember, this tax revolution must necessarily be accompanied by a drastic drop in public spending, the first threat to the fate of our children."
