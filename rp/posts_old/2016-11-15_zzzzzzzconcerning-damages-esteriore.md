# HABNA: Concerning damages

Posted by: esteriore

Nations involved: Esteriore, Habna, Hiachijan

Esteriore is taking full responsibility for the tragedies of this terrible war and will pay for all damages caused, even those by Hiachijan, as we want to continue diplomatic relations with them.

The bulk of the money will be payed to Habna to rebuild infrastructure destroyed by the continuous bombing of urban centres. Homes will be provided in Esteriore during reconstruction. And concerning the Solborgian tourists, they are being sent back home in an airplane as we speak.

Corrupt Government officials who approved the bombings of city centres will be jailed for war crimes. Their entire bank accounts are being drained and shared with refugees affected by the war.
