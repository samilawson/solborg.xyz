Nations involved: Habna

The Order of Violet had declared war on the state of Habna, in favor of the rebels.
Order leader says that the Habnian people were once the center of a vast Violetists state spanning half of Europe but it fell apart shortly before the rise of the current government in the twelfth century.
They promise that if they try to return some Habnians back to violetism the rebels would make the empire reemerge,and Habna would be great again.
The Violetist also desire to eliminate those not of Habnian decent excluding the order members who came to aid Habna,beacuse the old empire was not just Violetist,
It was specifically Habnian Violetist.

The order leader promises that by the end of the year, they would have Jiosev Moah's head on the altar!
