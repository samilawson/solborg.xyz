# NMC: Norrland Motorway Commission

Posted by: Solborg

Nations involved: Uppsala Kommun, Solborg, Hjaartlund, and Kievinki

Solborg has proposed creating the Norrland Motorway Commission (NMC) to oversee the construction of regional highways. The commission will include all nations that are interested in joining the highway project. The commission will vote on standardized road markings, signs, speed limits, etc. to be in effect on the regional highways. The expenses of the highways will be paid 40% by the nation the highway is in and 60% by the commission's members, who will all contribute equal amounts.

To propose a highway project, make a list of all of the cities the highway will link. Then assign a number to the highway that hasn't already been used. Lastly, you will need to come up with a lane ratio (example: 70% 2+2 lanes, 30% 3+3 lanes). Post all of this information on this site under the Norrland Motorway Commission (NMC) category. Solborg will then come up with a price estimate and an amount that each nation would need to pay. All of the nations the highway runs through will have to approve the highway for construction to begin.

To start off with, Solborg is proposing two highways (you can see them on the regional map) to be built in Uppsala Kommun, Solborg, Hjaartlund, and Kievinki:

**Norrland Motorway 1 (N1)**

Luleå, Uppsala Kommun - Vasa (Vaasa), Solborg - Pori, Solborg - Turku, Hjaartlund - Helsingfors (Helsinki), Solborg

10% 2+1 lanes, 80% 2+2 lanes, 10% 3+3 lanes

**Norrland Motorway 2 (N2)**

Pori, Solborg - Tammerfors (Tampere), Solborg - Jyväskyla, Solborg - Kuopio, Kievinki - Joensuu, Kievinki - Ilomantsi, Kievinki

30% 2+1 lanes, 65% 2+2 lanes, 5% 3+3 lanes

The estimated prices can be generated once all the nations involved join the NMC.
