Nations involved: The City-States of Kataria

After today's Senate Elections the long standing coalition between the Socialist, Democratic, and People's party has been broken as The Senate President Senator Lim(S) has lost his election to a young upstart from the Freedom Party. This is just one of the 3 seats lost by the Socialists and probably reflects a growing discontent with President Oswell. The new Senate is led by the author of the Anti-Hiachijanese Immigration Bill, Senator Lovecraft(F). He will lead a coalition between The People's Party, the Christian Party, and the Freedom Party which holds 25 of the 40 Senate seats this session. Secretary Arriah, one of the leaders of the Socialist Party commented that he hoped the Senate would be smarter than to pick Lovecraft who he has called, "A global catastrophe waiting to happen." Lovecraft is not up for reelection for another 6 years.
