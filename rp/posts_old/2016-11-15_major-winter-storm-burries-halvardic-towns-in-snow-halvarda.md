Posted by: halvarda

Nations involved: Halvarda

A major winter storm named "Akseli" has reached the coast of Artwistic Fjordland, a far-northeastern county of Halvarda, causing havoc. Over a hundred homes were completely buried by snow in the town of Loikaarta alone. Tens of thousands of homes are left without electricity. 

As the storm moves southwestwards, it is supposed hit the city of Ã…kysaanna - fourth biggest in Halvarda - where construction of a new motorway has started last night. Officials from Halvardic Transport have announced they are worried that the construction of the northern part of H1 motorway might have to be delayed until spring. 

Forecasters have warned the public to stay indoors during hazardous weather. Cancellation of any travel plans to and around the region of Gaarna tomorrow is strictly encouraged.
