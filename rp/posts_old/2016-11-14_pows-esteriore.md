Posted by: esteriore

Nations involved: Esteriore, Habna

Esteriore has just captured a rebel force of 179 people as Prisonners of War. They will be kept under strict guard in a prison built on an island near the coast of Esteriore.

Torture will be used for interrogation (to an extent). One of these POWs has admitted that the leader of the rebels is currently hiding in an underground bunker in Zutsnan. A special assassination task force is currently being sent there to kill the leader who's name is unknown.
