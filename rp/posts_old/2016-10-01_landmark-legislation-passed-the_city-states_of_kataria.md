Posted by: The_City-States_of_Kataria

Nations involved: The City-States of Kataria, Hiachijan

Today a bill that would ban all Hiachijanese citizens that are not Katari-Residents from entering the country was passed by the House and Senate. The bill was proposed by a young Nationalist from Fros Vegas named Senator Lovecraft in response to the refusal of The Empress and Emperor of Hiachijan to turn over Stanley Garson to the Katari Government. On the passage of this bill The City-States of Kataria also released a report of its missile defense systems saying that they have achieved the landmark of +/- 1 mile accuracy which is sure to reassure the Katari people with tensions rising.
