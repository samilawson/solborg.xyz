# EST: Norsolonia Will Begin Testing Prototype H-Bomb

Posted by: Norsolonia

Nations involved: Norsolonia

Norsolonia has successfully created a prototype Hydrogen Bomb and will begin looking for a suitable testing ground. It is unknown what the yield of the bomb will be but it is rumored to be somewhere from 10 Megatons to 25 Megatons of TNT. Once the bombs are complete Norsolonia will not allow Esneria to be ravaged by some barbaric nation. Any threats or attacks upon Esneria after this conflict will be taken as an act of war against Norsolonia and will be met with whatever force is necessary to ensure no nation demands anything Esneria rightfully owns again.
