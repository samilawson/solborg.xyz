# HABNA: Esterian aid enlightens Moah

Posted by: habna

Nations involved: Habna

Moah is touched that despite being such a free nation Esteriore came to his governments aid.
He stated in a meeting that if and only if he wins, he will promise to start to adjust policies in Habna to have a more Esterian government style.
Despite this ,the rebels ,since they have already been through so much ,are determined to keep fighting atleast until the rebel Provence of Border is an independent country, since advancing toward the capital now would threaten to cause nuclear detonation by Moah, but sceptics were never confident Moah would ever actually do that.
