# HABNA: Esteriore in Violation of Numerous GA Resolutions, Sanctions Enacted

Posted by: solborg

Nations involved: Solborg, Esteriore, Stockgrove, Firge, Magma Bananas, Betiutia, Vladimirstan, Kievinki

The Solborgian government has accused the government of Esteriore of violating GA resolutions 6, 9, 18, 37, 201, 323, 340, and 342, and committing crimes against humanity in the process. As a result, heavy sanctions, currently supported by seven nations (Solborg, Stockgrove, Firge, Magma Bananas, Vladimirstan, Kievinki, and Betiutia), have been enacted against Esteriore.

The effects on Esteriore's economy are expected to be crippling. Solborg has refused to withdraw sanctions in response to the illegal imprisonment of 78 Solborgians as hostages, and the government has instead tightened them. Vladimirstan, a significant military power, has also taken the side of Solborg.
