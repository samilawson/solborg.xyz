# HIA: Hiachijan Responds to Recent Issues

Posted by: hiachijan

Nations involved: Hiachijan, Esteriore, the Kolam Brotherhood

Hiachijan, after another brief period of relative silence, has awoken again. This time, they have turned their hive-minded eyes towards the Kolam Brotherhood's economic issues, and Esteriores proposal to an international space program.

On the subject of the Kolami economy, Hiachijan is disappointed upon hearing of the failing agricultural sector, which the Brotherhood is so dependent on. The Hiachijanese government has made a statement towards the Kolami people, claiming that private industry is a terrible path to go down. As is with Hiachijan, there was no opposition to this statement within the Alventocracy. Hiachijan has recommended that the Kolami government returns to state-owned industry, and that the Hiachijanese people will be willing to start a trade route, and "guide" the Kolami people as they abandon private industry.

On the subject of the space program, Hiachijan is willing to join this coalition, on the condition that no programs or launches of foreign nations are performed within the country. The Hiachijanese are specifically excited to start exploration programs of Venus.
