Nations involved: New Woking

As New Woking enters its' strongest era since its' founding, the government would just like to congratulate the citizens for their continued push for civil and political rights.

The economic climate is currently at the peak of its' career, with the bitcoin being among the top 12% in strongest currencies within the region.

There will be a nation-wide bank holiday every 18/11 to celebrate this success, where world leaders are invited to travel to the nation for a good meal with a few drinks.

Power to us.
