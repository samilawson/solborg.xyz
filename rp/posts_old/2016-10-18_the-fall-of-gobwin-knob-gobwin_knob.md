# GEN: The Fall of Gobwin Knob

Posted by: Gobwin_Knob

Nations involved: Gobwin Knob, Kataria, Nerisis, Hiachijan

With Stanley the Tool in hiding in Hiachijan, and all other government officials dead. The Empire of Gobwin Knob as finally been determined as collapsed since the Mysterious occupying force from Nerisis has not allowed any new government to spring up. From this point the country will slowly die. Maybe they will return to the Norrlandic stage one day, and Stanley the Tool may remain an important figure in IntraNorrlandic Politics. But this post marks the end of an Empire.
