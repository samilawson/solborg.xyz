# GEN: Inter-Norrland Highway

Posted by: Esneria

Nations involved: Norrland

The Esnerian travel minister has just proposed an inter-nation highway throughout Norrland.

We asked the finance minister about this, and he responded in a hasty manner saying: "This highway will make Norrland even more connected. It will facilitate trade and will ease travel in Norrlandic nations"

The proposed highway will connect all mainland Norrland nations and an underground road to Tyrandur and Solborg is also being discussed. All nations connected will have to chip in a little bit of capital of course, but the cost will be all worth it.

All nations that would like to take part in this project can post on the Norrland RMB or contact Esneria directly through a telegram.
