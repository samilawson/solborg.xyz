# New Categories Added

A couple changes have been made:

First, LOCAL has been changed to GEN for general. I just thought this made more sense because not all of the posts tagged as LOCAL were actually local.

Second, the tag EST has been added. This is for posts related to the Esneria/Esteriore conflict. From now on, if you are posting anything related to this conflict (even if you are another nation), choose the Esneria/Esteriore option in the menu on the post creation page.
