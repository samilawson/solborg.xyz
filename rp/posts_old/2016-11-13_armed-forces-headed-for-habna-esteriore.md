Nations involved: Esteriore, Habna

Esteriore will be sending several fighter planes and tanks to Habna in the coming days siding with the Habnian government.

These tanks and fighter planes are some of the strongest in all of Norrland, and will aid the government in repelling the violetists and the rebels. 

The prime minister stated today: "We in Esteriore believe in order, which is why we are siding with the government on this one. We may recieve backlash from the Norrland community, but we will continue to stand by our values and fight for order! Glory to Esteriore!"
