Nations involved: Skolborg, Skolborg Space Initiative

Rohan Mohajee, the new director of the Skolburger Space Initiative (SSI) announced that the semi-public space agency of Skolborg is interested in a common effort of Norrlandic Nations towards a better understanding of space. 

The Administrative assembly decided to allow all Norrlandic nations to use the launchpad in Barbados to launch rockets, as it is close to the equator, allowing to profit from a faster earth rotation necessitating less fuel, as well as surrounded by the ocean, allowing to avoid any danger if the launch fails. 

"This is only the first step" says Mohajee, who also announced that the Initiative's $28 billion budget, composed of 53% of State Contribution and 47% of Private Shareholder Contribution is "open to modalities to finance a common mission or station".  

The SSI calls other Norrlandic nations to be involved as well, in order to  share budgetary and scientific wealth.
