Samsonia2 has officially decided to support the government of Habna. No spending has been authorized for military uses yet.
 On the humanitarian side, Samsonia2 has formally authorized $3.5 Million to be used for sending aid to the citizens of Habna and for the setting up of refugee centers. Unfortunately, to access Samsonia2 from Habna, refugees must either cross the Bay of Biscay or trek through Samsonia3. Samsonia3 is expected to adopt a formal stance on the civil war soon.
