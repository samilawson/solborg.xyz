# GEN: Important Roleplay Changes

Posted by: solborg

Nations involved: Everybody

I have made some major changes to the regional map and roleplay events. Here is a list of what has happened:

Roleplay changes:

1) SJW Sweden has been removed. All events tagged "SWE" are no longer canon.

2) The WOV are now located in the middle east. You can still create events relating to terrorist attacks from them, but keep this in mind.

3) Stockgrove is now a territory of Firge instead of Solborg.

Map changes:

1) Since SJW Sweden has been removed, Scania is now free for the taking.

2) Solborg has been relocated from Ireland to southern Finland, bordering Uppsala Kommun, Kievinki, and Hjaartlund.

3) Trondheim is now part of Norsolonia, and Firge's northern border has been slightly extended in the East to make up for lost territory.

4) St. Petersburg has been given to Kievinki.
