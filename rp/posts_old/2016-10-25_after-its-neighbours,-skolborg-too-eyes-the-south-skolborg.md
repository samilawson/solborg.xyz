# GEN: After its neighbours, Skolborg too eyes the South

Posted by: skolborg

Nations involved: Skolborg

In a recent announcement Chancellor Erik Oswald Selbsen signed into law a colonisation program in the Carribean. It is not nearly as large as Esteriore's or Hiachijan's, compromising "only" the island of Barbados. 

the Easter half the island would be placed under military control and used to build a military base and a space launch base in order to conduct the recently created and funded SSI (Skolburger Space Initiative).  It will also offer another spot for Skolburger troops, especially the Air Force and Navy. 

Minister of Family and Social Affairs Johanna Louisville promised that the natives that would be delocalised would be treated humanely and freely housed on the Western half of the Island. The Western half will act as a province, with great amounts of self autonomy. A special parliament will be created, with 15 out of 45 seats exclusively reserved to natives. 

The operation will start in a few hours and be conducted by the air force that will land in Barbados and annex the island in a few days. 

A Parliamentary Commission has been mobilised to make sure that the colonisation takes place in fair and humane conditions to "not repeat the errors of our past".
