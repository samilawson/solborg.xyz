# GEN: Assassination of Massimo Franco

Posted by: Esteriore

Nations involved: Esteriore, Cavalla Province

A Cavallian nationalist has just assassinated prime minister of Esteriore Massimo Franco. The incident happened after a wrong turn was made downtown of the capital.

The perpatraitor was Alexandro Cattivo. He killed the PM using a standard M9 pistol. After shooting Massimo twice, he attempted an escape but was quickly caught by the police. 

There has been a very strong independance movement in Cavallia recently, but nobody expected it to get to a point like this. A new prime minister will be elected very soon. In the mean time, premier of Migliore will take Franco's place.

Many people are speculating that a civil war will break out. We hope it will not come to that. For the moment, government officials will be speaking with thepremier of Cavallia to work out a deal.
