# HABNA: Day 3 of Civil War, Tragic Escalation

Posted by: habna

Nations involved: Habna

Fighting further escalated today as the entire Provence of Boder along with its provincial capital, Minadrad.
The workers and collective third class have sent 500,000 people out of the city and Provence now homeless and trying to resettle both in northern Habna and abroad, especially in Stoichia.
A large secondary movement of people being the angry peasants are fleeing to Border as the mainstream nationalist government has started to massacre them.
All in all the death toll of the war has tripled to 365,000!
65% being civilians.
The new government in the south of Habna made by the rebels under Mazeltov are destroying all massive projects made by Moah.
Moah rallies people in the streets of Arisap in outrage against what has happened to his stuff.
Moah changes the national motto from
Heta-haila ; Habna! (Supereme state; Habna!)
To
Heat-haila; Moax! (Supreme state Moah!)
The nationalist loyalists of Arisap heil Moah with their arms...
The people of the unaffected towns start to fear influence as refugees camp by and the news acts more and more agressive.
