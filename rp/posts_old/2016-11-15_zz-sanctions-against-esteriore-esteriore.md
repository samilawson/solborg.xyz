# GEN: Sanctions against Esteriore

Posted by: esteriore

Nations involved: Esteriore, Solborg, Hiachijan

Esteriore demands that these sanctions be cancelled immediately, or all captured Solborgian tourists will be executed via firing squad. If war is ever declared, Esteriore has many nations backing them, notably Hiachijan, a large military power.

The defcon warning is now at Stage 3, and the entire Esterian missle arsenal is ready to fire instantly. We are ready to deploy our entire air force within 5 minutes, our anti-missile defense system is also on standby. We recommend that Solborg treads lightly and does not escalate this conflict any further, because a war would have devastating impacts on the region.

Our colony is also ready to expand ruthlessly throughout South America. And no North american nation would dare attack us.

-The Esterian Defence Bureau
