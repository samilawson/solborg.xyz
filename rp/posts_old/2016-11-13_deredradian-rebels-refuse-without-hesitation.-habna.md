# HABNA: Deredradian rebels refuse without hesitation.

Posted by: habna

Nations involved: Habna, Esteriore

The Deredradian Rebels considering themselves as far as they can go without triggering a doubtful nuke want to stand there ground as they say their movement is the only hope for the third class to have a place in Habna other than the slums routinely torn down for projects for the middle and upper classes.
The rebels burn the Esterian and Habnian Flags along with parading their own flag which is just the original Habnian flag with a black star on it.
Warriors of Violet claim that they are the main supporters of the new rebel Habnian state and that Violet is in their favor.

The federal government of Habna is ready to send 100,000 troops against deredrad, directly from Arisap.
