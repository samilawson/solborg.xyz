# GEN: Currency

Posted by: Esneria

Nations involved: Norrland, Esneria

Esneria is proposing a region-wide currency for Norrland. As of now, the name of the proposed currency has not been determined, but is expected to be named in the coming hours. If any nation would like to propose a name, please send a telegram to Esneria, or post the name on the RMB.

We hope that this currency is adopted throughout the nation, as it will facilitate trade region-wide.

-The Esnerian Financial Bureau
