As debate within the Senate comes to a conclusion as to how exactly this small new coastal territory east of Raulandia will be maintained. All are in agreement that a supply line is crucial to this naval base's upkeep. With that in mind the opening between Kievinki and Iron Giant Incorporated is a strong candidate for the foundation of a ground-based supply line. It's also been determined that our cargo planes are a viable option as well. To guard our interests a harbor master will be posted there with a current bare minimum of 30,000 soldiers.
