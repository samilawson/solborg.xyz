# HABNA: Stoichia sends people to Habna

Posted by: stoichia

Nations involved: Stoichia, Habna

Starting tommorow, Stoichia is going to send people to save civilians in Habna and bring them in Stoichia. 

The PM of Stoichia, Garth Lovren, is currently trying to decide if he will keep it this way or close borders with Habna as a high number of Habnians are coming in Stoichia both legally and illegally.

A poll will be made to see if Stoichians would accept Habnians in their country.
