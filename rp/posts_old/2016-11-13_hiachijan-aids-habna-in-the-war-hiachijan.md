# HABNA: Hiachijan Aids Habna in the War

Posted by: hiachijan

Nations involved: Hiachijan, Habna, Esteriore

After issues in Habna become more and more significant, they have grabbed the attention of the Alventocracy. Hiachijan has contacted the Habnian government, and has offered to help to rid the country of "rebel filth." The Alventocracy has yet to release a full statement as to why they are doing this, but their history suggests that they are doing this out of boredom, or simply because of Hiachijanese morals.

Considering the significant decrease in the rebel population, the Habnian goverment asked for minimal firepower. The Hiachijanese militaristic standard for "minimum" was equivalent to five hundred Advent legionaries in total. No more, no less. They will be transported to the Habnian coast via ten carrier jets, each carrying fifty legionaries, all of which are highly experienced and heavily armed. Outcome has yet to be documented.
