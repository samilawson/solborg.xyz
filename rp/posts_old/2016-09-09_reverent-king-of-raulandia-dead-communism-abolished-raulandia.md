# GEN: Reverent King of Raulandia dead, Communism abolished

Posted by: Raulandia

Nations involved: Raulandia, Norrland

Our beloved king of old, HÃ¥vard Lysenfryd, has tragically died of old age. As Raulandia mourns the passing of their great leader, there is one thing that cannot be ignored; The ban imposed on capitalistic tendencies, enacted by the late King, has ended with his life.

The goverment and the new King Ivar II Lysenfryd has, after long debate, decided that Communism should be slowly dismantled. A social democratic goverment is taking its place.

Rauland is now opening channels with the Norrlandic Region to commit to trade deals, agreements, and bribes.
