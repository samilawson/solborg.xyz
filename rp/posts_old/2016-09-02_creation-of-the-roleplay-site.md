# Creation of the Roleplay Site

As you can probably see, I have created a site to organize all of the roleplay events in Norrland. This is because it was becoming increasingly difficult to keep track of all the new events people were posting on the RMB, and it was a pain to constantly update the old News Articles dispatch. From now on, this website will be used to post new information about roleplay events. The RMB may still be used to discuss them, but in order for something to offially happen, it must be posted on here. Below are some of the features:

1) __Events will be organized by subject.__ For example, all events regarding the war against the Warriors of Violet will be clearly marked with the tag __WOV__. This makes it much easier to tell what's going on.

2) __Each event will clearly show the nations involved.__ This will make it much easier to keep track of nations in coalitions and collaborative work.

3) __News articles will be easy to find.__ News writers can pin their articles regarding an event directly onto the post of the event. You will no longer have to search through multiple news sites or check the outdated News Articles dispatch to keep up.

4) __Unrealistic events can be removed.__ If an event is deemed too unrealistic, or it breakes the rules set for each roleplay subject, it can be removed by a moderator, and everyone will know to ignore it. This removes any confusion with questionable developments.
