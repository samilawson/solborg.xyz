# HABNA: Mandalae Starts Humanitarian Aid Campaign within Habna

Posted by: mandalae

Nations involved: Mandalae, Habna

The Western Republic of Mandalae will now commence a large-scale humanitarian aid campaign within the nation of Habna. This comes after many Mandalaeans exhibited shock and dismay at the government's lack of action towards preventing the violent civil war. Protests broke out across the country in major cities such as Barker Pass, Truckee, and even the capital, Santandem. Supply planes have already begun to take off and are en-route to Habna, where they will distribute their supplies and resources to the displaced population, while staying out of any military conflict.
