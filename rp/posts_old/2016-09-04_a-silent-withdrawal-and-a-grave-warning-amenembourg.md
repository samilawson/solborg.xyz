# WOV: A silent withdrawal and a grave warning

Posted by: Amenembourg

Nations involved: Amenembourg

This is a time that is "fraught with threats" said John Luke, the President of Amenembourg. With the risk of fire in SJW Sweden, the real threat of Violetist terrorism and the rising tensions in Basilias, the Amenembourgian Congress has quietly ended the military intervention of Amenembourg against the Warriors of Violet and the countries that brought their support to them.

This morning, in a deserted Parliament, the Federal Government and the Congress have agreed and voted to end the participation of the Technocracy of Amenembourg in the Coalition. The repatriation of troops and equipment has already begun and should be completed in three weeks.

According to some political analysts, Amenembourg has participated in the Coalition to achieve some secret objectives. Indeed, some testimonies of migrants have reported the use of new and dangerous weapons that have been tested against the civilian population under the pretext of fighting and bombardments against terrorists. The sudden disinterest of Amenembourg Intelligence Services for what is now happening in SJW Sweden would be an indicator that the authorities of Amenembourg no longer have any interest in participating in the Norrlandic Coalition.

However, the Congress has maintained and enhanced the exceptional measures and budgets to strengthen the borders and homeland security. Among the laws passed this morning, one of them contains an amendment providing for the installation of 2,655,122 additional CCTV systems in public space. There will now be nearly 16,021,544 CCTV systems installed in the streets of Amenembourg.

Regarding foreign policy, it seems that the State Department now wants to revive an isolationist policy and focus on trade and innovation with regional partners.

As for the occupation of SJW Sweden by the armed forces of Basilias and Stoichia, President Luke said : "It is inconceivable that the region will accept that a member like SJW Sweden be invaded under false pretexts to serve a questionable imperialism. Especially as Basilias showed a dangerous determination in order to invade a territory that can not belong to Basilias. The West can not tolerate an Islamic power led by a megalomaniac leader can thus interfere in the affairs of a small country at the slightest disturbance. Especially if this power intends to achieve a dream of territorial expansion which will spell the end of the regional cohesion. Amenembourg will not tolerate the incessant provocations of the Shah of Basilias. His words, his actions and ambitions are a threat that is built gradually. Amenembourg is an economically powerful nation and will invest in its defense to face any eventuality. It is time for us to reconnect with an army capable to set limits to overly ambitious neighbors who might ogle at our wealth and envy our prosperity.".
