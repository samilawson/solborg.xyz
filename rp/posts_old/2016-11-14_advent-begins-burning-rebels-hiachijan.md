# HABNA: Advent Begins Burning Rebels

Posted by: hiachijan

Nations involved: Hiachijan, Habna, Esteriore

Hiachijan's legionaries from Advent have been at work in Deredrad for a day now. Despite the small size of the force deported to the Habnian coast, the number of casualties inflicted by the legion has been relatively high, and increasing as time passes.

The imperium has been torturing captured rebels as Esteriore has, usually via brute force or flamethrower. Information received from them, unfortunately, was of very little use, but legionaries will not give up, now trying their best to refrain from killing on sight. That way, Advent has more rebels to interrogate.
