# SWE: Hiachijan Aids Slovossia in the War

Posted by: Hiachijan

Nations involved: Hiachijan, Slovossia, Stoichia, Basilias, SJW Sweden, Warriors of Violet

Earlier this morning, at 7:01 AM (DHT), Emperor Yumeni and Empress Azila awoke the nation from its slumber by announcing an official declaration of war on SJW Sweden and the Warriors of Violet, as well as a Declaration of Friendship with the Federation of Slovossia.

Empress Azila stated, "The point for both of these sudden movements was to gain territory upon mainland Norrland. Seeing as though Slovossia sought after the same thing, we must as well make the mission easier for both of our nations." Empress Azila stated that she, and Emperor Yumeni, were happy to work with Slovossia, whilst ignoring, but not unaware of, the rising tensions between Slovossia and Basilian/Stoichian forces.

Emperor Yumeni has clarified that the borders of any claimed lands on the mainland will have their borders open to Slovossia and other certain countries. The main Hiachijanese islands in southwest Norrland, however, continue to keep their borders closed from all Norrlandic countries.
