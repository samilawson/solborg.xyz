# ECO: Rebels move units to Dlatrus

Posted by: habna

Nations involved: Habna, Esteriore, Hiachijan

Since Deredrad and Minadrad are under severe attack rebels have been preparing themselves in Dlatrus for "a fairer fight"
The city of Hisna-anri and all of northern Habna are under strict enough government control to stop rebels from gathering there.
Deredrad is currently under siege by Gobernment and Esterian forces.
Hiachijan's small force combined with some squadrons of isolated Habnian soldiers have finally made the city of Minadrad surrender, and Minadrad was renamed a large town after it was found only 20,000 residents remained.

Nationwide the casualties are now an astounding 550,000.
Refugees number to almost 3 million nation wide but most of them are settled in camps in the North of the country guarded by Habnian and Esterian soldiers.

Whole neighborhoods of refugees living in tents have filled the Central Park system of Arisap
