# Post Category Information

I have recently added a new post category titled "SJW Sweden" in the post writing panel. This is to be used for posts relating to the Basilian/Stoichian occupation of the land and/or conflicts with Slovossia. The Warriors of Violet tag is specifically for attacks and other events directly from or against the WOV terrorist organization, not the governments of any countries.

Just for clarification
