# ECO: Refugees turn to the sea

Posted by: habna

Nations involved: Habna, Esteriore, New Habna (Habna)

Esterian troops have made travel into Stoichia difficult, and the lands to the southeast are currently closed as well but due to other reasons, Migrants gather in camps on the Western shore especially in Hisna-anri, 
Also rebel migrants who would have an even harder time on the path to the northeast border have no choice but to join this new route.
Where are they going? They are all going on lower-class boats, fishing boats even, to try to make it to Habna's oversea territory, New Habna. Also called Amaldrus "roughly translating to hope land"
