# GEN: Space program

Posted by: esteriore

Nations involved: Esteriore

Esteriore is proposing an international space program to Norrland. After a recent spike in the Esterian economy, Esteriore has been looking to invest in other things such as space exploration.

We are proposing a coalition of nations to build a rocket powerful enough to leave earth's orbit and explore the cosmos. This project of course, will be quite expensive, which is why we are asking for help of other nations.

If you are indeed interested in this proposition, please make an RMB or RP post notifying it.
