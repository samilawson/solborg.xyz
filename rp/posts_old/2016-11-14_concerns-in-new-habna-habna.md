# HABNA: Concerns in New Habna

Posted by: habna

Nations involved: Habna, New Habna (Habnian Colony)

Its not new news that Habnian colonists feel under-represented by the Habnian government, but this feeling has had massive growth as now the government is consumed by the civil war going on back at home. In fact premier Moah even forgot where the colony was on the map,yet he has risen taxes in them to pay for not only the war but the extravagant projects he was doing prior to the war.

There are concerns New Habna may try to leave the union in this time of chaos.

An independent New Habna is unlikely to keep its name and the colony also appears that it could be a major competitor to the space agency in Barbados; since New Habna is even closer to the equator.
