# GEN: Chancellor Olsen arrives in Krytyyk. 

Posted by: skolborg

Nations involved: Skolborg, Krytyyk, Esteriore

Chancellor Erik Oswald Selbsen and Rolland Freisler, Minister for defence, as well as several diplomats and space experts to visit a number of bases in Krytyyk as well as the Krytyyk Space Program have landed in Krytyyk hours ago. Chancellor Selbsen will also visit the newly established Skolburger Air Force base in Northern Krytyyk. 

Questioned on the recent events in Habna, Selbsen announced that "Skolborg has never supported those who position themselves against democracy. But using torture against torturers is reducing oneself to their level, and is definitely not showing the example", which can be interpreted as a condemn of Esteriore's actions in Habna. The interpretation is corroborated by the cancelling of intentions to buy Esterian Fighter jets, as well as a modification of the route taken by the FEATHER1, the Chancellor's aircraft, to return to Skolborg in order to avoid flying over Habna and "getting shot down", according to the only words of the director for the Chancellor's Security. The new route is kept a secret. 

However, Selbsen quickly changed subject and announced he was not in Europe for this, but to visit the strong and long time military ally of Skolborg, Krytyyk, with the objective to learn from their military and space program.
