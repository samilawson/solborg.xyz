# HABNA: Solborg Severs Ties With Esteriore, Sanctions Likely

Posted by: solborg

Nations involved: Solborg, Esteriore, Hiachijan

Solborg has severed all diplomatic ties with Esteriore following the sabotage of a humanitarian mission in Habna and the killing of 5 Solborgians. The government has mandated that all staff and officials in the Esteriorean embassy in Tammerfors leave the country at the first possible opportunity in the next 48 hours. A number of Esteriorean government members, including the minister of foreign affairs, have been banned from entering Solborg. A number of other nations are expected to follow suit.

The government of Solborg is also expected to negotiate sanctions against Esteriore and Hiachijan with other European nations for the two countries' torture programs. So far, Firge, Magma Bananas, and Stockgrove have indicated that they will support any measures taken by the government of Solborg. Solborg's Prime Minister said today that Esteriore and Hiachijan "must be held accountable by the international community for their inhumane and counterproductive torture programs." He also called the incident in Habna "an appalling act of unwarranted aggression, not only against [Solborg], but also against the victims of this conflict who have been denied the resources they need to survive."
