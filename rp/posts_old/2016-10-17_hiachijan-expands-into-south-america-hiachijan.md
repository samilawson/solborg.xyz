# GEN: Hiachijan Expands into South America

Posted by: Hiachijan

Nations involved: Hiachijan

For a few days now, the Hive-Imperium of Hiachijan has abruptly begun the colonization of the great continent that has been lying south of their collection of islands. They have expanded along the massive river system at the continent's northeast coast, and plan to, potentially, expand into the continent's massive rainforest.

The Hiachijanese have claimed that said rainforest is fragile, and easy to kill off, therefore, they should be the only ones trusted with preserving it (and in truth, they have done well to preserve the natural beauty of their islands to good extent). Empress Aulmerri currently leads the colonization operation, and has already claimed official territory for the Imperium. Emperor Yhumeni is tasked with keeping his eyes on Kataria's next movements, but has claimed that he will try his best to avoid direct conflict with the city-states.
