# HABNA: Foreign Affairs

Posted by: esteriore

Nations involved: Esteriore, Habna, Solborg

In response to the sanctions and ousting of the Esterian ambassador to Solborg, Esteriore has captured 78 Solborgian tourists currently in the country. The Prime minister, Massimo Franco calls Solborg an "Axis of evil"

The tourists will remain imprisonned until Solborg removes all sanctions on Esteriore and Hiachijan. They are being held in the most secure prison in the country, EMS Jos√©.

The Habnian government has demanded that Esterian troops leave the northern half of the country. The Defense Minister has responded by refusing this, and keeping many troops there until the war is over. Esterian troops are also marching toward rebel-held cities in southern Habna. These rebels will be kept in camps until a formal decision is made on what to do with them.
