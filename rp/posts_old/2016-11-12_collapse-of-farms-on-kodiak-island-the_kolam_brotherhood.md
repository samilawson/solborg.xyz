Nations involved: The Kolam Brotherhood

-- By Editor Xustyl Aquexyl-- 
NEW KODIAK -- The Kolam Brotherhood's new industrial zone and airport has led to the depletion of farmland on Kodiak Island. The Kolam Brotherhood is very reliant on it's agricultural sector, so the Kolami economy is currently deprived of success due to the creation of these industrial areas. Ever since the introduction of private industry, many Kolami industries like agriculture, mining, and fishing have depleted, falling to manufacturing and forestry. While some may argue that The Kolam Brotherhood's future will generate success with manufacturing sectors, many government officials believe that private manufacturing will corrupt the economy and destroy the environment.
