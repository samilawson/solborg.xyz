Posted by: habna

Nations involved: Habna, Esteriore, Solborg

Habna does not appreciate that the Esterians were wandering in the northeast part of the country attacking other aid's units.
Prop,owe Jiosev Moah clarifies that Habnian soldiers can control that part of the country themselves, as there are no rebels there, the same can be said for some of the northwest.
If Solborg is not giving military aid they can simply drop out of the conflict as Stoichia is already taking care of humanitarian issues.

Also it has been confirmed that atleast 1 million Habnians have left the country,
And that Deredrad has taken great damage.

So far 
15,000 Esterians have died
14 Hiachijanese have died
520,000 Habnian civilians have died
154,000 rebels have died
And 115,000 Habnian soldiers have died

The conflict has displaced 3.5 million nationwide!
