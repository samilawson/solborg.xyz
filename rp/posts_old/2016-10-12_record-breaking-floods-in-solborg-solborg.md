# ECO: Record-Breaking Floods In Solborg

Posted by: Solborg

Nations involved: Solborg

Solborg has been experiencing many severe, record-breaking floods for the past two weeks. Scientists say climate change has played a major part. The flooding has significantly delayed construction of the Norrland Motorways in Solborg, and thousands of people have been trapped in their homes. As many as 8 people are believed to have died as a result of the flooding. Prime Minister Cooper Johnston called the floods "a stark reminder of the threat climate change poses to all of our nations." Solborg's far-left Environmental Initiative party has doubled its popularity in recent opinion polls.
