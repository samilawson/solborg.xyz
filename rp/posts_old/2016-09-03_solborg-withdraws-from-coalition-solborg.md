# WOV: Solborg Withdraws From Coalition

Posted by: Solborg

Nations involved: Solborg, Stockgrove

Solborg is officially withdrawing from the coalition against the WOV after the fall of Malm√∂ to Basilian and Stoichian forces. The primary reasons are a lack of continuing support from the population, the large numbers of civilian casualties, and the lack of necessity for further Solborgian involvement.

Greater Solborg has also been placed under an indefinite state of emergency following the attacks in Strathpeffer, Stockgrove. Border security has been drastically increased, and Stockgrovean police are now conducting extensive raids against suspected WOV targets.
