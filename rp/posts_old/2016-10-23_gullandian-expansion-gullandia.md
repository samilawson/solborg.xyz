# GEN: Gullandian Expansion

Posted by: gullandia

Nations involved: Gullandia, Hiachijan

Realizing the fact that colonization will soon become a necessary part in remaining an economically impactful nation on the world stage, Gullandian Grand Council Asbj√∏rn Rasmussen, along with the support from both of The Houses, has formed a trade deal with Hiachijan allowing the use of one another's ports. These ports will be used by newly created G.E.C.A. (Gullandian Exploration and Colonization Administration) as a jumping point for ships headed for The New World. G.E.C.A. will also be in charge of proposing laws within the colonies and encouraging immigration.

The first scouting ships set off this morning from Thulsatsuaq to find a suitable area to claim in The New World. They will likely arrive in Hiachijan within the next few days; a few days after that, they should arrive in The New World and prepare a location for the colonization ships.
