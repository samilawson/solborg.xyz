# GEN: Krytyyk Expands Northward

Posted by: Krytyyk

Nations involved: Krytyyk

On October 17,2016 the majority of the Senate has agreed that it's time to move towards the coastline directly north. This action will open more trade routes for the Republic and allow us to finally build a navy. We plan on founding this new colony on the small coastline directly east of Raulandia as well as appointing a governor to see to it's safety. More information will be available soon.
