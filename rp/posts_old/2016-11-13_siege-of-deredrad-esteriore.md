# HABNA: Siege of Deredrad

Posted by: esteriore

Nations involved: Esteriore, Habna

A siege has begun in the city of Deredrad. The rebels occupying the city have been surrounded and supplies have been cut off completely. 

We are proposing a deal for the rebels in the center of the city; The rebellion gives up on revolting against the government and we crush the Warriors of Violet, or we push into your territory. The rebels have 12 hours to make a decision.

We will make no hesitation to siege and/or bomb more cities if this deal is refused. 95,000 More troops are being sent to Habna right now as we speak.

-The Esterian Government
