# ECO: Halvardian Storm

Posted by: esteriore

Nations involved: Esteriore, Halvarda

Esteriore is preparing its national guard to fly to Halvarda to dig out the population. They will be landing in about 3 hours with an army of snow plows, shovels, bulldozers and food.

Esteriore will not require any pay for these services, brcause Halvarda and Esteriore are very close allies, and Halvarda doesn't have the economy to handle such a thing.

-The Esterian Foreign Affairs Bureau
