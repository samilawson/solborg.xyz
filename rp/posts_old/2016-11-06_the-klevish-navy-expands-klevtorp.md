# GEN: The Klevish Navy Expands

Posted by: klevtorp

Nations involved: Klevtorp

During a meeting held by the Admiral-in-charge a decision was made to expand the Navy and units belonging to it. It was decided that the rapid-reaction forces should get 10 more Abborren-Class landing crafts. Some speculates that the Navy will attack the Kvarken islands located between Klevtorp and Solborg, but this is only a speculation. The new addition to the rapid-reaction forces has an estimated cost of 1,2 billion Klevish Kroner.
