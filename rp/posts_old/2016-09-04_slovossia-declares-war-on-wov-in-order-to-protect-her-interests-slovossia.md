# WOV: Slovossia Declares War on WOV in Order to Protect her Interests

Posted by: Slovossia

Nations involved: Slovossia, Basilias, Stoichia, and SJW Sweden

In an attempt to grab mainland territory in Norrland, Slovossia has official declared war upon SJW Sweden and the WOV.

Slovossia plans on using this territory to ensure safe trade to and from Norrland and plans on establishing military bases in the territory. The new land may also serve as a jumping point for future expansion.

When asked about his reasoning, President Platim Vludin had this to say: "Our great nation cannot be contained on these tiny islands any longer. We must expand inland and the simplest way to accomplish this is through SJW Sweden. Our expansion is necessary in developing our nation into a superpower and defending our lands and freedoms from future threats."
