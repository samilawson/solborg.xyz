# TRADE: Brodar-Nordahvaland Bridge System

Posted by: brodar

Nations involved: Brodar, Nordahvaland

In conjunction with our close ally, Nordahvaland, Brodar is beginning construction on a series of tunnels and bridges connecting the nations of Brodar and Nordahvland to facilitate trade and tourism between the two nations.  We look towards the Ã˜resund Bridge for inspiration and hope to surpass it as the longest road and rail bridge. Brodar is putting forth 15 billion Brodars towards the project and hopes the same from Nordahvaland. The bridge is expected to have paid for itself twofold by 2030.
