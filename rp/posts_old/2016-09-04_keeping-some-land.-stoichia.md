# WOV: Keeping some land.

Posted by: Stoichia

Nations involved: Stoichia, Basilias, Slovossia

The PM of Stoichia has announced that the land they will get with Basilias will be split between the two countries. The PM thinks that the land Basilias gets will be annexed, while Stoichia will only occupy the land they got for some time. 

Stoichia will try it's best to make a great country out of the land they got, with a great economy, civil rights and nearly no crime at all. 

After the occupation the country will be released as a fully independent state.

The PM has said that he is not sure what Slovossia will do with the land they get if they get any at all but he hopes they will not do anything bad like using it as a way to have more influence over the countries in mainland Norrland.
