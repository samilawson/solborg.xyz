# HIA: Emperor & Empress Refuse the Extradition of Overlord Stanley

Posted by: Hiachijan

Nations involved: The City-States of Kataria, Gobwin Knob, Hiachijan

Emperor Yumeni and Empress Azila of Hiachijan, who have only now heard of Kataria's request for his extradition, have stubbornly refused to deport him from the country.

The details given by the pair remained fuzzy, with the Empress simply saying, "Yes, he's of foreign descent. We never accept people into our nation when they're of such. Although, this man, well, let's just say he has our respect and our service, and we will not boot him out based on another nation's petty morals."

Emperor Yumeni had given a much less detailed response, merely saying, "I like him, though."
