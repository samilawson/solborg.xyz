# HABNA: Esteriore and Hiachijan Form an Alliance

Posted by: hiachijan

Nations involved: Hiachijan, Esteriore

With the recent threat of trade sanctions by various Norrlandic nations, Hiachijan has proposed an alliance with Esteriore's Prime Minmister, Massimo Franco, who agreed to this movement.

The alliance is said to prevent the sanctions from having a large impact on the countries' economies, and Emperor Yhumeni and Empress Aulmerri are hoping it will succeed in making the two nations more powerful in the event of war.

The entirety of the Hiachijanese military has begun preparing for war, if it is to occur, and is now currently on standby.
