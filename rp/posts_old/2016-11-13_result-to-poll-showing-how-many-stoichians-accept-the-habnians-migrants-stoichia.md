# HABNA: Result to poll showing how many Stoichians accept the Habnians migrants

Posted by: stoichia

Nations involved: Stoichia, Habna

Recently a poll has been made to see how many Stoichians do actually accept the Habnians in their country.

The Poll shows that 68% of Stoichians accept the Habnian immigrants, 22% do not, 3% of Stoichians had mixed feelings about the situation and 7% of Stoichians did not give their opinion.

The PM of Stoichia, Garth Lovren, has repeatedly shown interest in aiding Habna making some people believe that he is only doing it to increase his approval rating which has dropped recently with the making of the wall between Stoichia and Paninyava and the involvement in the Born crisis.

With only one year until the next General Election, Garth Lovren may want to do something that will make people vote for him and his party once again. If he fails it is most likely that the rising Community Party will be the one to win.
