The head of the paramilitary commando involved nevertheless made ​​this statement to reporters : "When you see a foreigner, and I can assure you that this aircraft was foreign, you don't ask if it is Violetist or Basilian because, truly, it's almost the same thing. What I told my men is shoot without fear. All my men and I were very threatened by this plane flying quietly and away. For us, it was obvious that it was a provocation. Fortunately, our artillery was still operational. As my grandma used to say, prevention is better than cure. At Lookforward Security, we are specialists in terms of practicing of preventive war."
