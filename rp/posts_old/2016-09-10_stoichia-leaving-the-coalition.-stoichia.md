# SWE: Stoichia leaving the coalition.

Posted by: Stoichia

Nations involved: Stoichia, Wastisia

The PM of Stoichia has announced that Stoichia will leave the coalition and make peace with Sweden.

As the PM said last week a puppet nation will be established out of the land that Stoichia was able to get. The name of the nation will be Wastisia.

Right now it is unknown for how long Wastisia will remain a puppet nation but it will surely be free soon.

The PM hopes that Wastisia will become better then what it's father nation was.
