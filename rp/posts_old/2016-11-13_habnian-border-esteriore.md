# HABNA: Habnian Border

Posted by: esteriore

Nations involved: Esteriore, Habna

The Esterian military has begun shutting down the northern Habnian border to contain refugees in the country. Camps inside of Habnia will be set up for the refugees trying to flee the country.

All refugees found near the border will be sent to these camps.  We will need no more aid from any more nations. Any nations who attempt to airlift supplies will have sanctions put on them. Any airplane from other nations will also be stopped and potentially shot down.

-The Esterian Defense Bureau
