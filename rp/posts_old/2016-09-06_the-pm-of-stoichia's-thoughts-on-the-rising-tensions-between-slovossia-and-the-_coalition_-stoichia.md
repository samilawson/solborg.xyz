# SWE: The PM of Stoichia's thoughts on the rising tensions between Slovossia and the "coalition"

Posted by: Stoichia

Nations involved: Stoichia, Slovossia, Basilias, Hiachijan

These is what the PM of Stoichia had to say on the current "conflict" between the coalition and Slovossia.

"We do not want to have anything with Slovssia. Even if we belive what they're doing is wrong we still do not see them as enemies. To me their attacks in the north of Sweden are helping. That is because more and more people are being sent to the north instead of the south. That makes it much easier for us.

We don't understand Hiachijan's involvement in this but if they want to help Slovossia then JUST DO IT. Probably the empress just thinks it is fun to help them but right now I don't care.

Hopefully this conflict will stop soon but because it's becoming worse then I expected."
