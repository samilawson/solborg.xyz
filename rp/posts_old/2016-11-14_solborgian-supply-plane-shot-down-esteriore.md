# HABNA: Solborgian supply plane shot down

Posted by: esteriore

Nations involved: Esteriore, Solborg

A Solborgian supply aircraft has just been shot down over Esterian controlled territory in Habna. 5 Solborgians were killed in the conflict. The plane landed in the North-Eastern point of Habna, and it burned for a full hour before the fire died out. No survivors were found.

We can see why nations would want to send aid to the Habnian people, but we can assure you that this situation is well under control. I hope this gives an example to ther nations that plan to send supplies over the border. Even after this incident, we will continue to shoot down all planes flying over the border.
