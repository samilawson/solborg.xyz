# GEN: Georgkenia still going on with its kinetic ambitions

Posted by: georgekenia

Nations involved: Georgekenia

As announced during the end of the war that stopped Georgekenia from having nukes. The nation announced it would develop a kinetic bombardment system instead.
It is very slow developing.
A sattelite was launched but it is not known how functional it is, Georgekenia will continue to heavily research for the next following months.
