# WAR(S): Adrea Holds Their Border

Posted by: fascist_adrea

Nations involved: Fascist Adrea, European Bolsheviks

Adrean soldiers, having had some rather effective defenses built up along the border (in most regions), has been able to react and defend its border for the most part, losing only a few feet of land before the remaining garrison was able to make its way to the border, calling off the search for the rogue nuke for the time being. The fighting has, for the most part, reached a stalemate, with the Adreans pulling what forces they can to defend the slowly receding border. With most of the forces in Georgekenia, it's become very difficult for a very effective defence to be set up with such little warning.

Iaerme Pales was unable to respond, as she was in the process of transferring to the Alexandrian Frontline, and is now making her way back, to fight the "Red Menace", as Souxand referred to them as, in a speech he gave in her place. "We will not quietly allow this," he riveted "and we will not allow them access to our land."

Already in Georgekenia, a large hole can be noticed in the once all-spanning airforce, as many aircraft are being transferred back to the Balkan region to fight the Bolsheviks in the air and on land.
