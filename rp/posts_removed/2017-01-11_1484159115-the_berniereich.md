Nations involved: Berniereich, Cacusia

However we are not relinquishing our annexation of Kolding. Whilst the territory is not under the complete control of The Berniereich, the other claimed area of the "immediate vicinity" of Kolding, i.e. 5 miles or 9 KM from the city borders, is controlled, and we are commencing a shipping blockade till the city submits.
