# TERRITORY : Former Icesage Lands Annexation considered

Posted by: conaim

Nations involved: Conaim, Icesage(collapsed)

In an unfortunate turn of events, the government of Icesage, Conaim's northern neighbor, has been obliterated!
The Icesage territory is in anarchy and certain groups are pushing to allow Icesage Statehood in Conaim.

Many in Parliment have also looked very favorite on the Expansion, others not so much...Many protesters have been using #ConaimIsBeautfulAsIs , fearing the border morph and its complications.

"This may have been normal in the 17 and 1800's" says protester Danny Boy, "but it's 2016 and we just don't do territory claims like this anymore, it's unethical and dangerous!
I love my country but if anything this could harm it."

Counter protests cry things such as this woman, Caley Charlas, "these people in the north need us!"
Mandalae hasn't said anything!" and you saw what happened in Skolborg when their collapse was ignored! Almost all of them died and they were removed from the map!"

Parliment is mostly torn but so far it is speculated the expansionistsmhavw the advantage, although some parts of Icesage might be handed over to Manadalae as compromise to the non-expansionists.
