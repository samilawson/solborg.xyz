# SPACE: Secret Plans Revealed

Posted by: esteriore

Nations involved: Esteriore

After recent questioning by Solborg, Esteriore has finally revealed the truth about the recently mentionned spy satellite. It was secretly attached to the back of the Fiamma I rocket for launch.

A cover-up was attempted to not draw attention to the previous launch. It was secretly used several times, notably during the portmany arms base incident when it happened. It is mostly used to scan the environment before land invasions, but will be used for spying. We are terribly sorry for this lack of transparancy, and will strive to do more in the future.
