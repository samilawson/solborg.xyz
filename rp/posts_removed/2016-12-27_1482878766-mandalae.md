Nations involved: Mandalae, the Kolam Brotherhood, Conaim, NAL, Vladimirstan

The nations of Mandalae, the Kolam Brotherhood, and Conaim have just announced that they will be enacting joint sanctions on Vladimirstan. 

President Hagden of Mandalae explained this decision, saying in a press conference, "Valdimirstan has repeatedly been invited to join the North American League, and has not once responded. Additionally, Vladimirstan refuses to cooperate with Conaim in the Mormon War, a struggle which is ripping North America apart. If the Vlads refuse to cooperate, we see no choice but to discourage this stubborn attitude. Hopefully the other members of the NAL will share a similar sentiment."
