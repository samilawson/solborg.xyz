Posted by: samsonia3

Nations involved: Esteriore, Samsonia3

Samsonia3's Aircraft Carriers and Interceptors have been positioned strategically to shoot down any Esterian aircraft flying above our skies. Samsonia3's neighbor, Samsonia2, has pledged to shoot down any Esterian aircraft that violates their airspace. All major cities are being evacuated temporarily and as many people as possible are being moved to bomb shelters.

On another note, Samsonia3's nuke has not been reported as heading towards any specific one of Esteriore's cities.
