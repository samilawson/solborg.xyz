# RECONSTRUCTION: Poll shows Habnian citizens are okay with reconstruction

Posted by: habna

Nations involved: Habna,Amaldrus

A suprisingly large 79% of Habnians are okay with the new reforms, 11% said they were not too happy but war is not supposed to be happy and that this was nessary, the last 10% are waiting to edit the acts in 2019, nobody wants to fight about it. They say that type of people no longer love in Habna.
Meanwhile in Amaldrus, rejection of Habna's action are stronger but they don't really care though seeing how they are no longer part of Habna.

After all nobody will be jailed for acting against the acts in Habna as the acts explicitly state that community service is the only possible punsihment. Jailing act-defilers would hurt the country say Habna's politicians. We need to work.
