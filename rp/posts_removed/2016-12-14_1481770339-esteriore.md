# SPACE: Satellite launched

Posted by: esteriore

Nations involved: Esteriore

A recently developped satellite secretly comissioned by the Esterian government has just launched, and is in orbit. It will be used as a spy satellite, similar to Kataria's. The launch was planned for tomorrow, but recent events have put pressure on the space team.

The largest conflict, of course, being the criticisms by several nations accusing the government of defying soverignity of several nations. The government will put more restrictions on spying and will use this satellite as an alternative to coventional spying.
