# WAR: Total War

Posted by: esteriore

Nations involved: Esteriore, Samsonia3

Following the recent news from Samsonia researchers have determined that the nuclear warhead launched from Samsonia3 is headed toward the histotic city of Rivolucita, also the largest one. The city is being evacuated, but traffic will clog the city and cause immense loss of life. It is expecte dthat roughly 600-800 Thousand people will die in the blast.

In revenge, all aircraft deployed outside of Esteriore will now be heading to Samsonia3 to bomb its cities and military bases. The PM has called this 'Only fair'. All government officials are also being sent to underground bunkers in Dellacita. We call upon our allies in this time of need and crush the axis of evil known as Samsonia3.
