# MORMON WAR: Mormon War continues

Posted by: conaim

Nations involved: Conaim, Utah, Vladimirstan

Things are very irritating and suspicious spas Vladmirstan has taken no action against the illegitmate state of Utah taking their lands, fighting continues at the border with the sons of Utah taking shelter and receiving supplies from Vladimirstan.
Conaim and its allies can not pursue them as that would violate Vladimirstan
About
16,000 Mormon radical soldiers have been killed
10,000 Civilians have been killed
And about 11,000 Conaimese regulars have been killed

A total Millitary death toll of 27,000
A total death toll of 37,000

While this is a baby war compared to what happened in Habna their are still children who lost a parent or two this Christmas.
In fact in some cases said child lost their own life.

Conaimese officials worry that Vladimirstan might somehow be in support of the illegitmate state of Utah even if it costs them land, but why would they?
