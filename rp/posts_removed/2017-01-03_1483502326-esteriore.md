# GEN: Samsonia3's messages intercepted!

Posted by: esteriore

Nations involved: Esteriore, NOPS, Samsonia3, LRN

Many messages detailing Samsonia3's plans regarding the potential war against the European Bolsheviks have just been intercepted and publicized.

They contained the plan to Nuke the European Bolsheviks to avoid violating the NOPS-Samsonia3 Peace Deal, which stated that a LAND INVASION was to be punishable.

The messages also revealed that Samsonia3 had no regard for international law, as they said they'd march through Adrea to get to Bolshevik Territory (Who is potentially Neutral).

We urgently request a response from Samsonia3 and NOPS officials regarding this potentially Nuclear crisis.
