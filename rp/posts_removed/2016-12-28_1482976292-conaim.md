# MORMON WAR OVER : Sons of Utah remains, left to devices in Utah territory.

Posted by: conaim

Nations involved: Conaim, Utah, Vladimirstan, Mandalae, Esteriore, New Nexon

After a severe raid from New Nexom, the Mormon state of Utah (or atleast what was left of it )finally wanted to negotiate, 
Mormons on Conaim are being deported on an Esterian plan to take the, to Baffin Island.
The survivors in Utah not controlled by Conaim, simply have to do one thing, not only not attack Conaim, but to never go back to Conaim if that was where they were from.
They still seem to be attempting to form a state in Utah, but it is weak and if Vladimirstan wishes to in the future, could easily invade and crush it. The only reason why the state still has an opportunity to form is the area is predominantly Mormon and sparsely populated and Vladimistan has shown their apathy towards the wasteland.

The war was fortunately fairly small,
75,000 Sons of Utah
48,000 Conaimese Regulars
30,000 Civilians
15,000 foreign fighters

168,000 casualties
