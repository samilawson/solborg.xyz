# SPACE: Enceladus Colony Expanded

Posted by: mandalae

Nations involved: Mandalae

The Mandalaean colony on Enceladus, Saturn's sixth largest moon, was just expanded with the arrival of 8 new Mandalaean astronauts aboard the "Saturn III".

The colony, originally composed of 10 scientists and researchers, will now house the 8 newcomers in additional facilities that just finished construction.

Although the "Saturn IV" mission, as it has been dubbed, is still in the early stages, 20 civilians will arrive on Enceladus early next year, in the hopes of creating a permanent outpost on the moon.
