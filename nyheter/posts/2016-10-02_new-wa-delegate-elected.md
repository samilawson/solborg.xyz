# Amenembourg Elected WA Delegate

Two weeks after Solborg was officially re-elected as Chancellor of Norrland, Amenembourg has now officially taken office as World Assembly Delegate. Amenembourg's ambassador to Norrland, George Sigurson, will represent the region of Norrland, which currently contains 290 nations, in the WA. The nation holds a total of 40 endorsements; Kataria, the previous delegate, holds 36. The position is not expected to switch back within the near future.

Solborg's public endorsement last week is believed to be what made the switch possible. Some member nations were dissatisfied by the lack of discussion and polls from Kataria, and both Solborg and Amenembourg highlighted this as a reason to change.

Despite the cooperation between the two nations, Solborg and Amenembourg already have a disagreement on the first step Amenembourg has taken as regional Delegate. On Saturday, Amenembourg called a poll to determine whether or not to propose a resolution the Security Council to condemn Mexipines. The results are currently split 50/50; polls close on Monday. Solborg has come out against the proposition, arguing that the conflict with Mexipines was too insignificant for the Security Council. Amenembourg disagrees and claims the "threats and insults uttered and repeated by [Mexipines]" warrant intervention from the Security Council.

While we are currently unable to determine whether or not the proposal will be submitted, it is highly unlikely that it will make it to the floor. Since the introduction of numerous new government positions, similar disagreements among government members are to be expected.
