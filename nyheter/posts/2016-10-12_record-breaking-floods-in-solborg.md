#Record-Breaking Floods Devastate Solborgian Coast

Cities across Solborg have been experiencing extreme flooding, with water levels rising as high as 70 centimeters in some areas. In Helsingfors, the largest and most severely affected city, as many as 1086 people are believed to be trapped in their homes by debris carried by the water. At least 8 people have died as a result of the floods. Prime Minister Cooper Johnston has since declared a national state of emergency.

Many climate scientists and other figures in the scientific community have pointed to climate change as a major factor in the floods; the overwhelming consensus is that things will only get worse with the current rate of warming. The Prime Minister addressed the nation earlier today and announced the following:

_"It is very clear this was caused by climate change; there's absolutely no question about it. These floods serve as a stark reminder of the threat climate change poses to all of our nations. I will be deploying the Solborgian Guard to Helsingfors and Espoo, among other cities in the area, to help with rescue efforts. In addition, I call upon my fellow heads of government across Norrland and across the world to see these disastrous effects already being caused by climate change. The weather is only going to become more extreme if we continue. We must put a stop to this now."_
